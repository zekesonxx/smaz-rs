<Namarrgon> Fr0stBit: pacman -Qm
<ishmael> ive never used awesome, but im quite happy with i3
<ishmael> V7: for themes, search on git for people's i3 dot files
<ishmael> or Xresources
<_Fr0stBit_> Namarrgon: https://ptpb.pw/KRFo
<V7> Thank you ishmael 
<poisonby> V7: Configure it yourself, check the i3 user manual and look up a bar like lemonbar or polybar
<V7> I'll search them in DevianArt and i3 
<V7> poisonby: I know, I just want to start from one and get another by myself 
<ishmael> the arc dark theme is pretty nice, imo
<V7> You're right
<poisonby> V7: Check /r/unixporn
<ishmael> and theres a theme for it for firefox too, so it goes together nicely
<V7> Ha ... I love how it's called :D 
<V7> Thank you post-factum 
<Namarrgon> _Fr0stBit_: you rebuild mesa-git et al after the update?
<V7> poisonby: 
<V7> post-factum: Sorry
<V7> So ... 
<_Fr0stBit_> Namarrgon: n0p, i'll try doing this
<V7> All in all ... I need LXDE DE with i3 WM ? :)
<ishmael> just i3
<poisonby> V7: No, no desktop environment.
<poisonby> It's superfluous
<ishmael> if you want a session manager, you could use something like sddm
<V7> poisonby: Sorry for missundertanding
<ishmael> but dont use a DE and a WM
<poisonby> ishmael: I mean, you could replace the WM of some desktop environments. It's just kinda pointless.
<ishmael> a DE is a WM plus a bunch of stuff
<V7> So ... the main: Arch+i3
<poisonby> To get things like gnome-settings, etc.
<V7> Okay ... now I understood
<ishmael> poisonby: right. youre better off just isntalling those components from the DE that interest you
<ishmael> rather than the whole DE and then a different WM
<V7> i3 won't let me do Ctrl+Alt+Right to change a desktop ? 
<ishmael> i3 will let you do whatever you configure it to do
<V7> hmm
<V7> It sounds like music
<Namarrgon> Fr0stBit: r600_dri.so from the repos is linked against libLLVM-3.9.so
<V7> Thank you one more time :) !
<ishmael> theres a pretty good youtube tutorial on getting started with i3 from some australian dude
<Fr0stBit> Namarrgon: when configuring mesa-git i get unknown gallium diver: ilo

<Fr0stBit> Namarrgon: 'The Intel ILO Gallium3D driver is no more, should be removed from PKGBUILD' does that mean that is unsupported in newer versions?
<Namarrgon> looks like it
<Fr0stBit> Namarrgon: i suppose that i just want the r600 so i could modify pkgbuild to ignore it?
<Namarrgon> sure
<Namarrgon> look at the official mesa PKGBUILD for inspiration

<eschwartz> Yeah, seems so
<Sirnanigans> I ran the command   gist -c -f .local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log   and it asked me to type a gist and press ctrl-d when done.
<Sirnanigans> I press ctrl-d and nothing happens, although it does seem to hesitate for a second.
<Sirnanigans> Anyway, there's nothing on my clipboard after that either.
<eschwartz> reactormonk: works for me, you'll have to give more details. ;)
<eschwartz> Sirnanigans: I don't use the command-line client, but looking at the manpage it appears -f asks for a filename, with the contents on stdin -- not an absolute filepath, which can be used without the -f.

<rmbeer> Namarrgon: jajajaja! yes, thinking that yes xD

<robattila256> cobalt-red: i can't find it been a long time since i customized weechat but just google "move buffer/channel top" ..etc 
<Dan39> YokoBR: most tiling WMs still have the ability for basic floating windows
<Dan39> its just not the default :P
<earnestly> eschwartz: I love the whimsical nature of it.  The first book Consider Phlebas touches on it a tiny bit
<Dan39> just like most floating WMs also have plugins for basic tiling
<robattila256> once you get the hang of i3 you probably wont use floating windows
<cobalt-red> YokoBR: honestly, it's not for everyone.  I found that I was using floating WMs like that anyway, so tiling was just logical
<eschwartz> earnestly: ooh "Someone Else's Problem"
<earnestly> eschwartz: I made a gitlab organisation called 'General Systems' ;(
<cobalt-red> Running linux, had them tiled.
<cobalt-red> Running Win8.1, had them tiled.
<cobalt-red> it's more of a personal style thing.
<YokoBR> Dan39: I know that, but I didn't adapted very well with tiling things :)

<cobalt-red> Dan39: interesting...

<Dan39> cobalt-red: what is interesting? o_O
<cobalt-red> Dan39: not using the tiling of a tiling wm.
<YokoBR> I've used openbox + tint2 for a long time. Now I'm using XFCE because it's just like gnome2 and I loved it back then. But i'll give i3 a shot
<wyre>  The right way to setup an static ipv4 address is with nmcli, right? 
<Irishluck83> you can
<sheep> wyre: you could do it that way, but there are other ways that might make more sense
<cobalt-red> I mean, I usually won't get more than 6 windows up at once, but there's only a couple times when I'll have a fullscreen window.
<Dan39> wyre: more details? what for? desktop, laptop? 
<wyre> sheep, more sense why? 
<wyre> Dan39, server
<earnestly> YokoBR: i3 is not exactly your traditional tiling wm "experience"
<YokoBR> does anybody knows a way to make the wifi-menu automatic? I don't want to install the networking package, because it doesn't work well with my BCM4313... Only that wifi-menu can AWAYS connect to wifi networks here
<cobalt-red> earnestly: ?  It seems like the "standard" tiling wm.
<earnestly> YokoBR: If you want a more pure version of that, try ratpoison.  Thought it might put you off entirely :p
<eschwartz> !give YokoBR netctl
<phrik> YokoBR: Users having issues with netctl are advised to try alternatives such as systemd-networkd, NetworkManager, or connman.
<sheep> wyre: there are options that don't require having NetworkManager, which is somewhat big
<cobalt-red> unless by "traditional" you mean tmux...
<Dan39> i use systemd-networkd
<cobalt-red> NetworkManager over here.
<YokoBR> I can't use netctl... because it doesn't work well with BCM4313
<Dan39> does the job...
<beest> wyre: using networkmanager for wired static ip is totally fine but kinda like using a yacht to haul a box of crayons
<Dan39> on laptops i use NetworkManager
<Dan39> or just wpa_supplicant

<cobalt-red> it's more like speedboat vs rowboat.
<earnestly> thrice: Curiously, how much is it using?
<eschwartz> "I can't use netctl"...
<beest> don't neuter my metaphors damn it
<cobalt-red> about the same size & weight, but one's a lot faster than the other.
<thrice> 5MB mem, 10mb shared
<cobalt-red> beest: but if you don't, there will be more of them!
<earnestly> beest: I was only just reading someone comparing llvm to hauling a backpack in a truck, while qbe is more like a bicycle
<beest> cobalt-red: and networkd will bring it up in half the time
<earnestly> thrice: Not bad at all, about as much as bash (which is bad)
<wyre> beest, resolv.conf?

<laudiacay> y'all aren't gonna like this question, but how would I run a java applet in chrome on arch?
<sheep> laudiacay: you can't
<laudiacay> sheep: any other browsers that'd work?
<sheep> none
<laudiacay> for real?
<sheep> chrome completely removed all of the infrastructure needed to run java applets
<laudiacay> how about like firefox or opera or smth
<eschwartz> YokoBR: netctl is a series of bash scripts around wpa_supplicant, systemctl, and other low-level tools.
<sheep> you might be able to use firefox, but I doubt that there's even an NSPR plugin for java anymore
<wyre> sheep, then what do you recommend me for a server?

<rmbeer> eschwartz: yes, but why? the client have predefined colours in the nick from install pacman? xD

<laudiacay> also kinda creepy
<laudiacay> but yeah anyway java applets on arch
<laudiacay> firefox is not doing the working thign
<YokoBR> eschwartz: I know. The problem is that BCM4313 is so buggy in linux. Because broadcom doesn't open source's.
<eschwartz> BCM4311 here, works fine with Networkmanager, or netctl if I want a horribly hacky UI

<eschwartz> Now, bcrmsmac is open-source
<eschwartz> But you specifically referenced b43 (the reverse-engineered driver that relies on restricted blobs)
<eschwartz> But as long as my logic is "unsound", I guess that is all that matters, right?
<amosbird> Hi, is there a better alternative to symbola font?
<eschwartz> Anyway, for me and the rest of the peanut gallery, Broadcom has a rather dubious history with open-source
<eschwartz> !aw broadcom wireless
<phrik> eschwartz: Broadcom wireless - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Broadcom_wireless
<cobalt-red> eschwartz: broadcom has a rather dubious history with closed-source too.
<cobalt-red> specifically, broadcom has a rather dubious history with working hardware.
<cobalt-red> !broadcom
<phrik> #fuckbroadcom
<eschwartz> cobalt-red: That is certainly true as well
<laudiacay> phrik: language
<phrik> please try to keep this channel family friendly and watch your language.
<eschwartz> cobalt-red: Welcome to the peanut gallery btw. :)
<eschwartz> !give phrik language
<cobalt-red> eschwartz: peanut gallery?
<phrik> phrik: please try to keep this channel family friendly and watch your language.
<eschwartz> cobalt-red: Apparently Hello71 has declared via fiat that broadcom is awesome and open-source friendly, and we are clueless
<cobalt-red> eschwartz: as someone who has developed with broadcom chips, they are neither.
<cobalt-red> !broadcom
<phrik> #fuckbroadcom
<cobalt-red> !fuckbroadcom
<phrik> cobalt-red: Say what?
<cobalt-red> but, eschwartz, does this mean we get free peanuts?
<cobalt-red> I'll bring along my pet elephant
<Hello71> but brcmsmac is not "from broadcom"
<Hello71> uh
<Hello71> (never mind)
<eschwartz> cobalt-red: Sure. :)
<cobalt-red> eschwartz: hang on, he's gotta finish up one or two commits to trunk.
<wyre> how can I see details of my network interface? 
<cobalt-red> ba dum tiss.
<wyre> kind of ifconfig? 
<cobalt-red> wyre: ip addr
<cobalt-red> or just the ip command in general, depending on what you want exactly
<wyre> cobalt-red, ipv4 address and dns
<rmbeer> i found that flash plugin is discontinued for linux and can't execute anymore, is this sure?
<sheep> rmbeer: no, chrome still provides a plugin
<occultus> rmbeer: what exactly did you hear?
<rmbeer> sheep: yes, only for chrome, it's read
<sheep> and the NSPR flash plugin is being maintained again
<rmbeer> "Flash Player will subsequently be available to Linux users only through Google's Chrome browser."
<occultus> rmbeer: that's old news, they changed back a few months ago
<Scimmia> rmbeer: you heard wrong
<rmbeer> oh, sure... 2012.......
<thrice> dont' worry, flash lives on
<hubcaps> pepper-flash works doesn't it?
* alexandr2 is now known as alexandros_C
<rmbeer> seem that really i can't open swf...
<sheep> hubcaps: if you can call flash workin
* alexandros_C is now known as alexandros_c
<rmbeer> hubcaps: not found the pepper-flash
<hubcaps> https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pepper-flash/
<phrik> Title: AUR (en) - pepper-flash (at aur.archlinux.org)
<sheep> chromium-pepper-flash is in the AUR
<Scimmia> sheep: chromium-pepper-flash has been gone for 6 months :)
<hubcaps> sheep: lol true, not exactly working, but it does something
<sheep> Scimmia: wait reallyt
<occultus> for firefox, flashplugin is in repos and up to date
<Scimmia> sheep: it's now the pepper-flash package, getting the plugin directly from Adobe and being used by many things other than Chromium
<sheep> neat
<Nobabs27> chromium-pepper-flash is way out of date I think
<sheep> well, not exactly neat
<Nobabs27> pepper-flash is more up to date I think
<Nobabs27> from the AUR
<sheep> I just use straight up chrome like a heretic
<hubcaps> last updated a month or so ago
<Scimmia> occultus: "up to date" is a relative term, it's missing a lot of features that the PPAPI version has
<occultus> Scimmia: like what? anything important?
<Scimmia> but it does have the latest version number
<Scimmia> occultus: hardware acceleration and DRM are the big one
<Scimmia> ones
<rmbeer> hubcaps: i trying download for install in the .local/lib/opera/plugin
<rmbeer> from the adobe site
<sheep> don;t do that
<occultus> Scimmia: ah. at least for me those aren't important
<sheep> rmbeer: did you try pepper-flasg from the AUR?
<sheep> *pepper-flash
<occultus> Scimmia: i think i only have it for the pandora web interface now
<rmbeer> sheep: no, i really not need this in my system, only for a app of a user
<sheep> rmbeer: you should always have it managed as a package if you can, especially if it's something that's going to be updated somewhat frequently
<rmbeer> sheep: the pacman also updated for package of AUR?
<sheep> no, but there are AUR helpers that can check AUR updates
<rmbeer> sheep: like yast?
<sheep> I have no idea what yast is
<Scimmia> the only yast I know has nothing at all do to with anything here
<Scimmia> suse stuff
<fishbulb> arg shit I forgot the passwd I just changed
<fishbulb> I mean, changed two days ago, and just tried to remember
<Boobuigi> Hey, pacman finally handles circular dependencies.  Nice.
<anhduy> never hit that problem before :D
<Boobuigi> It snagged usbmuxd and libimobiledevice for me.  A month or two ago, it would have just failed.
* Boobuigi can't remember whether or not he changed a setting.
<Scimmia> there hasn't been a pacman update in the last couple of months
<Namarrgon> don't blame pacman for the shortcomings of your helper
<thrice> 5.0.1 is over a year old
<Boobuigi> My "month or two" is usually 6-12 months.
<jiblet> hey I am trying to install libudev however when I try to install libudev it asks me if I want to remove libsystemd in order 
<jiblet>                 to install libudev. Im assuming I shouldnt remove libsystemd, but what should I do? 
<thrice> jiblet: libudev comes with systemd
<Scimmia> Boobuigi: the last update is beyond that time period. Not a pacman issue
<thrice> if you have a package that is asking for libudev (AUR junk?), just remove that dep
<Boobuigi> Scimmia: ... I'm saying it's not an issue at all, as it was handled automatically.
<jiblet> ya AUR junk, thanks
<Scimmia> Boobuigi: and I'm saying it has been handled automatically for many years
<jiblet> thrice well actually the error im getting is  error while loading shared libraries: libudev.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
<Scimmia> jiblet: there's a shim package available in the repos for that
<thrice> ah, something wants a really old udev version
<jiblet> Scimmia: link?
<Boobuigi> Scimmia: I see.  What else would cause an -Syu to require user intervention, then (not counting package name/content changes)?
<jiblet> also thank you :] 
<Scimmia> jiblet: pacman -Ss udev
<jimidovich> hi, youcompleteme question pls.. how does it work with python3 virtualenv? i mean i have packages installed in venv and nothing for system python. Ycm cannot popup completion
<Scimmia> Boobuigi: all kinds of things, most of them from the AUR
<fishbulb> my root password is lost to the ether
<Scimmia> fishbulb: so boot the install disk and reset it
<fishbulb> that might be a problem, I used it to install some shit on a netbook
<Scimmia> fishbulb: why would that be a problem?
<fishbulb> I don't have the same copy of the distro
* m712 is now known as sshd
<Scimmia> doesn't matter
<Scimmia> no password need to chroot
<fishbulb> havne't done that before
<raynold> ahh it's a wonderful day
<fishbulb> hey can I use any distro to do this?
<Scimmia> fishbulb: remember when you set the password while installing? Same thing
<Scimmia> sure, you'll just have to mount a few more things maually without the arch-chroot script
<fishbulb> fuck
<sheep> namely /dev, /proc, and /sys
<Scimmia> yep, should be covered in the wiki
<wyre> sheep, why is happening this? https://hastebin.com/pegerasepe.css
<phrik> Title: hastebin (at hastebin.com)
<fishbulb> this whole "you'll learn 100% about your computer if you do it the arch way" applies to "doing it the arch way over and over and over UNTIL you have learned that shit"
<ponyrider> jimidovich: imap <c-l> <c-g>u<Esc>[s1z=`]a<c-g>u
<ponyrider> wait
<fishbulb> installing it once a year or something is like expecting to do weights once a year and become a bodybuilder, so "the arch way" is sort of fucked up, especially when it comes to installs, which don't happen very frequently
<laudiacay> fishbulb: u don't have to reinstall
<laudiacay> the trick is just break your shit constantly
<ponyrider> jimidovich: YouCompleteMe requires Python >= 2.6 or >= 3.3 so you shouldnt need venv
<ishmael> fishbulb: what are you going on about?
<Scimmia> fishbulb: we're talking about simply using chroot. This is pretty basic
<sheep> wyre: no idea. did you configure something to rename it back to eth0?
<fishbulb> the trick is to not break it so it lasts longer
<fishbulb> not breaking shit is why I have stuff
<laudiacay> like yesterday i learned all about window managers because i trashed my graphics drivers in an effort to make the LEDs on my graphics card blink in pretty colors
<laudiacay> but now i'm really good @ i3 
<laudiacay> so 100% worth
<ishmael> :D
<Scimmia> tweak until things break
<ishmael> dont see how RGB on your graphics card relates to your WM, but cool nonethe less
<jimidovich> what was that...  so if say i need numpy function complete, i must install it in system?
<laudiacay> Scimmia: yes in fact meth is very useful for working with linux
<rmbeer> sheep: i use the pepperflash and still opera can't view this plugin...
<rmbeer> sheep: i install in the .local and /usr/lib/PepperFlash
<sheep> rmbeer: you might need to try another browser. or maybe there's a setting in opera to load it
<rmbeer> (copy)
<rmbeer> sheep: yes, i try with opera://plugins , but never show in the list of plugins
<laudiacay> ishmael: i broke the graphics drivers, then my window manager flipped shit on launching (otherwise the system was fine lmao), then i realized my setup was garbage cobbled together from various peoples' tips from all over the internet, then i realized gnome was garbage... and then it was 3 am and i had a paper due this morning and no idea how to use i3 which i had just installed
<laudiacay> so i had to learn to use i3 good enough to open google chrome, which actually took a very long time because it was 3am
<sheep> rmbeer: did you restart opera?
<thrice> that story makes no sense
<rmbeer> sheep: yes
<sheep> rmbeer: I have no idea then
<eschwartz> Boobuigi: ISTR that that is something which as fixed in the current git HEAD
<wyre> sheep, I don't know
<wyre> I've only installed NetworkManager 
<sheep> wyre: it's probably something you may safely ignore
<wyre> but now is uninstalled and disabled the service
<laudiacay> thrice: yeah it was 3 am my logical capabilities were approximately "oo pretty colors" "o shit" "ooh i3 looks shiny" "oh fuck i don't know how to work i3 or exit it"
<wyre> sheep, yes, I know that's not something bad, but I would like to know what's doing that :S
<sheep> wyre: I'm not sure
<Boobuigi> eschwartz: Thanks!  I was wondering about that.
<wyre> sheep, this is my configuration https://hastebin.com/ewuqefemun.makefile
<phrik> Title: hastebin (at hastebin.com)
<eschwartz> Boobuigi: Ah, it should be commit 6ac2ee21b30f3c5f331d19349f96bb8e5b020b47
<sheep> wyre: that looks ok to me
* lagothri1 is now known as lagothrix
<wyre> maybe is because I put that name ... 
<wyre> could I remove [Match] section? 
<wyre> and keep only [Network] section? 
<eschwartz> https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/commit/?id=6ac2ee21b30f3c5f331d19349f96bb8e5b020b47
<phrik> Title: pacman.git - The official pacman repository (at git.archlinux.org)
<wyre> or maybe use Name=eth0 ?
<sheep> iirc you must have a mach section
<sheep> *match
<sheep> and you should use enp3s0 instead of eth0
<wyre> sheep, why? 
<eschwartz> Boobuigi: Which is v5.0.1-37-g6ac2ee21
<sheep> because the eth* names aren't guaranteed to be consistent
<wyre> ok :) 
* fstd_ is now known as fstd
<wyre> but could I've named enp2s0 for instance? 
<sheep> the match section won't rename interfaces
<wyre> sheep, ok, but in any case ... that's rename is a systemd-networkd.service thing 
<wyre> that has not to do with me ... I think
<wyre> all about NetworkManager has been removed and disabled 
<wyre> so I think that's operation is intrinsic to systemd-networkd service
<Scimmia> eschwartz: he was talking about update/install, though, not remove
<ponyrider> wyre: the kernel does that: Arch kernel: ath9k 0000:02:00.0 wlp2s0: renamed from wlan0
<wyre> ty ponyrider :P 
<wyre> well, then I guess that's all fine setup using networkd :) 
<wyre> ty guys! :D
<wyre> see you tomorrow :) 
<javaisnom> !xd
<phrik> javaisnom: Say what?
<Boobuigi> eschwartz: That's the one!  Thanks.  Did you contribute?
<eschwartz> Boobuigi: Nope, but I am subscribed to the ML and I remembered it.
<eschwartz> Scimmia: That wasn't how I read Boobuigi's statement, not sure why install would be a problem anyway.
<jimidovich> ponyrider: thx. do you mean i must install packages in system python? say i want numpy func completion
<ponyrider> jimidovich: yes install with the system packages. use venv for other things. function completion is dont with other things like ultisnips/vim-snippets
<jimidovich> ponyrider: does this YCM conficts with neocomplecache or syntastic? i have them installed
<ParkerR> Anybody know of an easy way to downgrade to Xorg 1.18 that automatically pulls in the needed dependencies. I've tried the couple of downgraders from AUR but they dont accept multiple packages as arguments
<KamiRath> which package group does grub belong in?
<KamiRath> It's not in base
<rmbeer> mission: use flash in the opera.... FAILED!!
<sheep> ParkerR: why do you need 1.18?
<sheep> KamiRath: it's not in any iirc
<eschwartz> !give ParkerR ala
<phrik> ParkerR: Let's flip through it to hunt our lovely bugs: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux_Archive
<rmbeer> now how to clean all this trash?? Dx
<eschwartz> Set your mirrorlist to go back in time to a specific date, then pacman -Syyuu
<ParkerR> eschwartz, Again doesnt help when I dont know exactly what dependencies tie into what
<ParkerR> sheep, amdgpu-pro
<eschwartz> ParkerR: Well, that is the point of using a full system downgrade.
<ParkerR> Aforementioned downgrading scripts from AUR already use the Archive
<sheep> I find it unlikely that it hasn't been updated for 1.19
<eschwartz> !partial
<phrik> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported
<KamiRath> sheep, so if I were following this step after arch-chrooting, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Configuring_the_boot_loader_6
<phrik> Title: dm-crypt/Encrypting an entire system - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<KamiRath> would I just pacman -S grub?
<ParkerR> sheep, Well it hasnt because they target Ubuntu
<sheep> KamiRath: yes
<eschwartz> !give ParkerR partial
<phrik> ParkerR: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported
<eschwartz> Setting your *mirrorlist* to the ALA, means you don't do a !partial and get full dependency resolution
<ParkerR> Thanks, not quite what I was hoping for. 
<ponyrider> jimidovich: should be fine
<ParkerR> I'll just wait
<jimidovich> ponyrider: tku sir
<eschwartz> ParkerR: Alternatively, you can rebuild xorg via aur/asp-git which will build against the current system
* PyroPeter_ is now known as PyroPeter
<eschwartz> (And then follow reverse dependencies backwards)
<obZen> On Arch linux virtualbox guest, I can't get full-screen res
<obZen> I installed virtualbox-guest-dkms
<obZen> And enabled virtualboxservice.service
<obZen> No avail
<obZen> I even used VBoxManage to set the res, nothing
<sheep> what about xrandr?
<Scimmia> obZen: status on that service?
<Scimmia> obZen: and are the modules actually loaded?
<obZen> Status: active (running)
<obZen> How can I tell if the modules are loaded?
<Scimmia> lsmod
<obZen> lsmod vboxdrv?
<Scimmia> pipe it to grep if you want, it doesn't take an argument like that
<obZen> lsmod
<obZen> I see vboxsf, vboxvideo, and vboxguest
<eschwartz> !give obZen pastefail
<phrik> obZen:  0  DAYS SINCE THE LAST BUFFER ACCIDENT: Clipboard safety is our union goal!
* SuperficialyLost puts on his buffer safety helmet and does up his pants
<Scimmia> so the modules are loaded and the service is runing. I'm out of ideas :)
<obZen> ._.
<obZen> Yeah idk
* eschwartz gives SuperficialyLost a gold star
<Scimmia> I don't run Arch in vbox, so I don't know a lot
* SuperficialyLost eats a gold star and feels his security go up by a third
* SuperficialyLost eats eschwartz
<watered> Are there two levels of governors?
* eschwartz shakes his head
<watered> one on kernel level and one on arch?
<SuperficialyLost> hmm thatd didn't help my security go up!
<KamiRath> can someone explain to me why the EFI partition is not encrypted in this wiki if it is a full system encryption? https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Encrypted_boot_partition_.28GRUB.29
<phrik> Title: dm-crypt/Encrypting an entire system - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<watered> A wild pokemon appears*** :O
<eschwartz> !give watered pokemon
<phrik> watered: press b
<Scimmia> KamiRath: how in the firmware going to read it if it's encrypted?
* KindOne_ is now known as KindOne
<KamiRath> Scimmia, I guess i'm still a bit confused about the difference between EFI and /boot. Especially if they are supposed to be full system encryptions, would a would be malicious actor be able to change the EFI boot code thus tricking the user into typing their passwords?
<sheep> yes, but Secure Boot is supposed to prevent that
<sheep> by making it so EFI will only boot bootloaders that have been signed by a key that the hardware trusts
<KamiRath> then there is mkinitcpio-chkcryptoboot which seems like secure boot but only for the /boot partition?
<KamiRath> sheep, ah okay
<sheep> I have never heard of that
<KamiRath> sheep, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Specialties#mkinitcpio-chkcryptoboot
<phrik> Title: dm-crypt/Specialties - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<KamiRath> seems like lipstick on a pig
<sheep> and, if someone can somehow interfere with your EFI System Partition, you have bigger problems
<rmbeer> !pig
<KamiRath> as if EFI partition is modified that is useless
<rmbeer> oh, sure... i can't access phrik...
<sheep> it would be easier fore them to install a hardware keylogger
<mklein> !pig
<phrik> clean your keyboard
<mklein> give rmbeer pig
<eschwartz> !give mklein f'
<phrik> mklein: Is that a question?
<sheep> plus if someone just wanted to deny you access to your system, they could just write junk to the first few sectors of each partition
<eschwartz> !give eschwartz f
<phrik> eschwartz: AAH THE FAILURE! IT BURNS!
<dale6998> Did something change lately with how the kernel handles Wacom Tablets?
<eschwartz> How incredibly ironic :(
<dale6998> The wiki is misleading me
<occultus> dale6998: libinput might be handling it now instead of the wacom driver
<KamiRath> okay, and lastly there is this. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Configuring_fstab_and_crypttab_2
<phrik> Title: dm-crypt/Encrypting an entire system - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<dale6998> lsusb finds it...how to check why/how libinput is falling short?
<occultus> dale6998: i mean, wacom used to control the tablet. now libinput wants to control the tablet. what exactly changed for you anyway?
<KamiRath> Is the keyfile mentioned there viewable in the LUKS header?
<sheep> no
<KamiRath> sheep, so i'm guessing it's some sort of public key encryption?
<sheep> it's not
<dale6998> occultus: not sure...this is a newer install, but before (about 6 months ago), i remember this was trivial...plug and play
<sheep> the LUKS header has several key slots. each slot contains the master key for the container encrypted with the slot's key
<solenodic> KamiRath: dm-crypt is asymmetric encryption: you provide a passphrase which gets stretched to a long key using a slow algorithm
<sheep> it doesn't actually store the key for that slot
<solenodic> which is then used to encrypt/decrypt data
<occultus> dale6998: what was trivial? all you said was "did something change about tablets" which is incredibly vague
<dale6998> occultus: now, it's being recognized, but not acting like an input device (can't control the mouse)
<solenodic> well actually my description's not entirely accurate
<mklein> dale6998: do you have one with touch support?
<solenodic> there's two parts of the key which create the actual key, one of those parts is stored in the LUKS header or key file
<solenodic> and the other is stored in your head
<dale6998> occultus: sorry, i mean that it was plug-and-play on a different machine 6 months ago or so..now when i plug it in, I can't move the mouse with the stylus
<dale6998> mklein: no, it's a cheaper stylus/pad combo with some pressure support and a button on the side
<occultus> dale6998: better. what "recognizes" the tablet now? and at some point an Xorg log will be helpful, in addition to the packages listed in "pacman -Qs xf86-input"
<dale6998> occultus: this is a different, more fresh install of arch
<dale6998> occultus: the machine i'm running now.
<KamiRath> solenodic, so should my LUKS passphrase be the same for /boot and my root partition?
<KamiRath> and then I just need to add a keyfile to stretch my passphrase?
<dale6998> mklein: ah, here it is:  CTL-470, Bamboo Connect from Wacom
<KamiRath> sorry, if it seems really newbish i'm trying to learn how this all works
<solenodic> KamiRath: hmm, are you trying to encrypt your EFI boot partition
<solenodic> sounds like a pain in the ass
<rmbeer> aaaah now seem i break the plugin of flash! now can't open in midori??? Dx
<KamiRath> solenodic, not really. If anything i'm trying to understand how arch-linux and encryption works
<dale6998> !pastebin
<phrik> Pastebin.com is swamped with advertisements and random captchas. Malware found on pastebin.com has resulted in it being blocked for some users. It injects CRLF line-endings. Please, use something else. Use something sane like https://ptpb.pw https://gist.github.com https://bpaste.net https://ix.io
<solenodic> at that point I would just use secure boot (wiping all of microsoft's keys off the system in the process)
<KamiRath> solenodic, i'm pretty sure secure boot and TPM are the best ways to secure my box's booting
<KamiRath> nvmd
<solenodic> anyways, not sure how much I can help, I've never tried starting a bootloader off a LUKS partition and I've heard it's a huge pain
<KamiRath> I think i've figure dit out
<solenodic> but for specific cryptsetup features I might be able to help
<KamiRath> well i figure i'd try out LUKS and then do veracrypt
<KamiRath> but it's taken me a full day to get something working and now i'm just trying to figure out the nitty gritties and what is responsible for what. Doesn't help that this is my first arch installation haha
<buckley310> i dont think you can encrypt an EFI boot partition
<buckley310> (the esp EFI partition)
<KamiRath> yea i dont think i can
<KamiRath> but the boot partition i can
<KamiRath> cryptboot's Github page talks about using secureboot as well
<buckley310> encrypting /boot/ but not the ESP?
<KamiRath> but i'm not sure how that all works
<eschwartz> Sure you can, you just need a bootloader that supports it. grub can
<dale6998> https://ptpb.pw/7ONu
<KamiRath> eschwartz, the EFI partition?
<dale6998> occultus: https://ptpb.pw/7ONu
<eschwartz> No, /boot
<solenodic> eschwartz: encrypting the partition the bootloader sits on is definitely possible
<solenodic> what isn't is encrypting the EFI partition, which is equivalant to the BIOS MBR
<KamiRath> eschwartz, so what is the difference between the ESP partition and the Boot partition?
<eschwartz> KamiRath: ESP is, as solenodic said, equivalent to the BIOS
<solenodic> KamiRath: the EFI system partition is where your hardware looks to know where to boot
<eschwartz> the boot partition is just the location of /boot with your kernel
<solenodic> KamiRath: /boot is an arbitrary path where a bootloader might be on some filesystem
<solenodic> and /boot may or may not be your EFI system partition
<KamiRath> so mobo boots UEFI which boots EFI from ESP partition which then boots grub which boots systemd? Did I get that correct?
<eschwartz> e.g. grub can reside in the ESP and load an encrypted /boot, systemd-boot cannot
<occultus> dale6998: ok. you probably don't *need* all of those but you at least have libinput, evdev, and wacom - one of those is probably handling or trying to handle the wacom tablet
<KamiRath> ah I see
<occultus> dale6998: your Xorg log should say which one is handling it
<eschwartz> KamiRath: mobo uses UEFI to search for an ESP, and loads grub (which is responsible for "booting")
<KamiRath> eschwartz, gotcha thank you!
<dale6998> occultus: i'm looking at /var/log/Xorg.O.log
<dale6998> occultus: should i see 'wacom' in here?
<eschwartz> KamiRath: UEFI is firmware (like BIOS before it), grub and other bootloaders are software which interfaces between BIOS/UEFI and an operating system kernel
<occultus> dale6998: are you using a display manager or startx?
<dale6998> display manager
<dale6998> occultus: display manager
<solenodic> so that's how encrypted /boot works... next time I find an encrypted /boot system I'll make sure to tamper with the fake grub that starts the real grub so instead it asks for an encryption password and uploads it somewhere
<occultus> dale6998: iirc log 0 might be the login screen and 1 once you login. whatever is the newest file is probably right in your case
<mklein> dale6998: what does `xinput` give you?
<dale6998> mklein: https://ptpb.pw/OLe8
<wolfcomm> how can i see which process is writing to stdout?
<dale6998> occultus: there's Xorg.0.log and Xorg.0.log.old
<dale6998> mklein: looks a little...light to me.
<occultus> dale6998: which display manager? probably 0.log and not the old
<eschwartz> solenodic: Which only works as long as grub doesn't use secure boot
<mklein> dale6998: not seeing the tablet on there...
<buckley310> wolfcomm, what's the context? is it a pty with background jobs?
<mklein> dale6998: try `grep 'Using input driver' /var/log/Xorg.0.log`
<mklein> I use startx in my ~/.xinitrc, so my Xorg.0.log is in ~/.local/share/xorg
<mklein> jumbled that one.
<mklein> I mean I launch startx from ~/.bash_profile.
<dale6998> occultus: no wacom found in that Xorg.0.log...Here is Xorg.0.log.old, however and that has some erros related to wacom:
<dale6998> occultus: https://ptpb.pw/lj1V
<dale6998> mklein: ok, hang on
<occultus> dale6998: gross. pacman -Syu
<eschwartz> mklein: That has nothing to do with where your logs are
<dale6998> mklein: both came up dry
<eschwartz> mklein: Your logs are in ~/.local/share/xorg because you are running rootless X
<mklein> I was just going to ask.
<dale6998> occultus: up to date...There is nothing to do
<occultus> dale6998: hmm. well the log *is* 6 days old. paste the newer log?
<dale6998> ok...searching the system with sudo find / -name Xorg.0.log
<dale6998> those are the only two logs
<occultus> dale6998: so paste it. you only pasted the old log
<dale6998> oooooh, whoops!!
<dale6998> occultus: i gotcha, hang on
<dale6998> https://ptpb.pw/3qCz
<dale6998> occultus: this is the other log
<occultus> dale6998: that's... also from 6 days ago. what display manager again?
<dale6998> occultus: i'm....i'm so ashamed...but, i don't know!  and i don't know how to know!!
<dale6998> occultus: how can i know?  i want to say DWM, but, i'm not sure
<wolfcomm> buckley310: yeah it'a a pty, no background jobs
<wolfcomm> buckley310: pts
<buckley310> wolfcomm, if you type 'ps', does it list anything except your bash prompt?
<occultus> dale6998: what about desktop environment, gnome, kde, xfce?
<wolfcomm> buckley310: cmds called main & uname
<dale6998> occultus: wait!  i figured it out!!  i used top and then tree to find xorg and looked for the parent process!  yessssss
<dale6998> occultus: it's lightdm, btw
<wolfcomm> buckley310: aha found it
<wolfcomm> buckley310: thx dude
<dale6998> occultus: i3
<dale6998> occultus: i love keyboards
<occultus> dale6998: are there any other xorg logs in /var/log/ like .1.log or anything?
<eschwartz> dale6998: By the way, consider switching from top to htop
<mklein> way easier to see everything, for sure.
<dale6998> occultus: those are the only Xorg logs on the whole system, Xorg.0.log and Xorg.0.log.old
<dale6998> eschwartz: will do!
<occultus> dale6998: have you not logged in for six days or something?
<dale6998> occultus: i'm not sure how i would even do that...i just found where these logs were after you asked by searching Google so i didn't look like a total doofus
<mklein> LPT: admitting to yourself that you're a noob is the first way to stop being one.
<linux_probe> hai, ima noob
<rnabinger> dale6998: alias logfiles='lsof -u$(id -un)  | awk "/w\s+REG/ {print}"'
<mklein> rnabinger: Wow! thanks!
<dale6998> rnabinger: holy shit
<rnabinger> dale6998: in your case, just run: `ps aux | grep -i xorg` to find the pid, then `lsof -p <found_pid>` both as root
<rnabinger> because you don't know if ZXorg is running as root or your user I guess
<dale6998> rnabinger: that's kung fu, right there!!  whippp-ha!
* eschwartz is now known as supernoob
<rnabinger> dale6998: its a simple concept ... things that are logging generally keep the file open for (w)riting
<rnabinger> lsof lists file descriptors
<supernoob> linux_probe: I win
<linux_probe> noway
<rnabinger> albeit the one-liner is a bit obfuscated because I wasn't it short
* rnabinger wanted a shorter one-liner
<dale6998> rnabinger: that's deadly
<supernoob> noobishness can only be defeated by embracing your reality
<supernoob> admit it; accept it; defeat it.
<dale6998> supernoob: ki-yahh

<piousminion> Are there any sort of overlay filesystems I can use with NTFS?  I want to rsync to an NTFS fs and somehow retain permissions, uid, gid, etc.
<rnabinger> ... the overlay type of filesystem?
<rnabinger> man mount?
<rnabinger> piousminion: oh sorry ... NTFS doesn't have permissions like that
<piousminion> rnabinger: I know. I was hoping to overlay some form of virtual FS that would retain that info in other files.
<rnabinger> piousminion: man ntfs-3g
<buckley310> piousminion, what is the NTFS filesystem going to be used for?
<rnabinger> piousminion: ntfs-3g provides a variety of methods for mapping permissions
<piousminion> buckley310: It serves many perposes, but the directory in question will contain a backup of verious system and user files.
<piousminion> I'm starting to think I might have to create my own permission backup system.
<rnabinger> piousminion: idk bro
<rnabinger> piousminion: have you read `man ntfs-3g` as instructed?
<piousminion> rnabinger: I have my doubts, but I'll check out the man page anyhow.
<SuperficialyLost> warning: efivars is  mounted writeable by default, which may cause permanent damgage to the system...
<SuperficialyLost> i just read, i like drinking and i like guns
<buckley310> piousminion, being a backup, can the permissions be discarded, or are they too complex to recreate?
<rnabinger> SuperficialyLost: omg you're right ... shit
<SuperficialyLost> yeah rnabinger , drinking with guns is fucken cool
<SuperficialyLost> !roulette
<phrik> SuperficialyLost: *click*
* SuperficialyLost breathes a sigh of relief and cats some random numbers into his efivars
<piousminion> buckley310: They could be recreated. The only files I care about the permissions of are in myBackup/etc really.
<buckley310> are you just concerned with another process accessing the files while it is mounted?
<rnabinger> piousminion: well permissions is a horrible way to guard something
<rnabinger> piousminion: encrypt your backups guy
<occultus> piousminion: do you really have to use rsync to an ntfs partition? would tar or an ext4 filesystem be doable instead?
<piousminion> occultus: It would be hard to browse and pull out single files from tar. ext4 would require splitting up my available space. :/
<piousminion> rnabinger: The permissions aren't for security of the backup. Rather, to ensure proper permissions when restoring from backup.
<supernoob> SuperficialyLost: The efivars thing was fixed in the kernel, I thought -- you can't clobber them anymore.
<buckley310> this drive presumably needs to be shared with windows then?
<rnabinger> piousminion: tar is the way for that
<supernoob> !give SuperficialyLost pastryroulette
<phrik> SuperficialyLost: Poppy seed roll
<occultus> piousminion: "tar tf archive" and "tar xf archive filename" or an archive manager
<occultus> piousminion: or possibly an ext4 filesystem-in-a-file on the ntfs partition, which is maybe a bit ugly but probably doable
<buckley310> i dont think you can do filesystem-in-a-file since ntfs-3g is fuse
<buckley310> :\
<occultus> buckley310: i guess i don't see what the problem is
<SuperficialyLost> supernoob: does that mean the wiki needs updating?
<SuperficialyLost> dont ask me to update it, ive updated enougth :P
<buckley310> occultus, i dont think you can mount block devices from inside fuse devices
<rnabinger> buckley310: huh?
<occultus> buckley310: it's not a block device, it's a file inside an ntfs partition
<rnabinger> occultus: tar tf is not correct
<occultus> rnabinger: i use it multiple times per day, what's wrong with it?
<rnabinger> piousminion: tar czpvf backup.tar.gz <file> [files]
<rnabinger> occultus: tar t doesn't create an archive ;-)
<buckley310> occultus, block device was the wrong phrase.
<buckley310> actually, ill try it. one minute
<rnabinger> buckley310: I'm pretty sure you can losetup a file that is on any filesystem (that has blocks backing it ... tmpfs is not like this)
<occultus> rnabinger: stop putting words in my mouth. tar tf was the response to "it's hard to browse a tar archive"
<rnabinger> occultus:   oooooo I'm super sorry
* rnabinger also recalls a way to mount a tar directly with fuse
<occultus> y'all are crazy, fallocate -l SIZE filename; mkfs.ext4 filename; sudo mount filename /mnt/point
<rnabinger> occultus: yeah that works ... but you need `-o loop` right?
<buckley310> hmmm, so you CANT losetup a file on ntfs-3g but you can mount it.
<buckley310> i was sure neither would work
<occultus> rnabinger: mount automatically sets up necessary loop devices in several cases
<rnabinger> occultus: oh sweet, I need to get with the times
<buckley310> also fallocate doesnt work on ntfs-3g
<rnabinger> doesn't ntfs support sparse files?
<occultus> buckley310: ah. dd if=/dev/zero something should work then
<SuperficialyLost> does wpa_supplicant not start without a config file? It doesn't seem like theres a lot in the config file anyways
<occultus> buckley310: or truncate -s SIZE, that one seemed to work
<buckley310> is this file-in-filesystem solution better than splitting the hard drive with partitions? its only slightly more fluid
<rnabinger> buckley310: also you could try:  dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/file/on/ntfs bs=1024 count=1 seek=$SIZE_IN_KB
<rnabinger> those essentiall fallocate should do something like that anywasy
<occultus> buckley310: it could easily be slower since it's two filesystems. it only really saves partitioning but might be worth it if the embedded filesystem is less than a GB or two
<grawity> fallocate is nearly the opposite of sparse
<buckley310> actually when i made the block file i juse used `qemu-img create`, but that's just me :)
<occultus> honestly for backups tar is better
<rnabinger> grawity: For filesystems which support the fallocate system call, preallocation is done quickly by allocating
<rnabinger>        blocks and marking them as uninitialized, requiring no IO to the data blocks.
<occultus> piousminion: long story short use tar unless you actually need something else
<grawity> right, which is still the exact opposite of sparse
<rnabinger> grawity: oh, because it is actually allocating blocks
<occultus> grawity: fallocate has options to make a sparse file instead iirc
<grawity> yes
<grawity> and even if your fs puts you on the quick lane, some will still do stuff in the background I think
* grawity noticed some weird behavior with fallocate on ext4, at least
<rnabinger> piousminion: you should just use tar whivh was created for this purpose.
<alyptik> lol omg
<grawity> lol no it wasn't
<rnabinger> Tape Archive
<alyptik> i was like those tar flags look funny
<grawity> rnabinger: tape being something that's a bit annoying to pull out individual files from
<grawity> with all the seeking you need
<martium> guys, how do i fix thumbnailing in my file manager? some files show their thumbnails, some just don't, even after i refreshed it.
<grawity> at least try something with a central file list, like zip/rar/7z
<rnabinger> grawity: yeah if I never have to touch a tape again ill be super happy
<grawity> martium: find ~/.thumbnails/fail/ ~/.cache/thumbnails/fail/ -delete
<rnabinger> grawity: none-the-less ... dump was used historically then tar
<buckley310> how often are these backups going to need to be accessed?
<grawity> martium: also check if they're above the file manager's configured size limit
<buckley310> if its often enough to be a problem, perhaps snapshots are needed, LVM, btrfs, ZFS....
<martium> grawity: find: ‚Äò/home/mars/.thumbnails/fail/‚Äô: No such file or directory
<rnabinger> buckley310: how is it a problem, you can pull individual files form tar and you can append to non-compressed tars
<alyptik> xfs soon \o/
<grawity> good, you were going to delete anyway
<SuperficialyLost> p
<SuperficialyLost> sorry wrong window
<grawity> rnabinger: how long does it take to scan through a several-gigabyte tarball for the file you want?
<grawity> rnabinger: if it's gzipped, ages.
<grawity> rnabinger: at least actual tapes could get away without reading the whole thing since they didn't use gzip
<buckley310> rnabinger, if the tar is 1TB, you need to wait for 500GB of IO on average to grab a fiekl from the middle
<grawity> if it's compressed, yes, that ^
<rnabinger> grawity: well thats what I am saying.  if random acccess is your use-csae then don't compress
<grawity> as opposed to finding a format where compression and random access can... coexist?
<gehidore> no way! impossible I say!
<rnabinger> grawity: like a loopback btrfs image?
<martium> grawity: ah, you're right about the size limit. it's fixed now, thanks.
<grawity> yes, like a FS image, or a zip/rar/7z archive
<alyptik> cake and eating woo
<grawity> well not rar/7z, they lose a lot of unix metadata
<rnabinger> grawity: none of those preserve file permissions though? right
<grawity> zip does
<gehidore> alyptik if btrfs dev doesn't pick back up you'll likely be right
<grawity> I'd do `getfattr --dump` before backing up regardless, to pick up xattrs and stuff
<alyptik> about what 
<rnabinger> grawity: zip can random acess files efficiently?
<alyptik> gehidore
<grawity> but it does preserve unix permissions
<grawity> and yeah it supports random file access
<grawity> due to compressing each file individually
<rnabinger> grawity: thanks (the more you know)
<alyptik> gehidore: i simply exclaimed i love eating cake
<alyptik> ;D
<grawity> (which in theory is a little less efficient, but in practice only matters if you have dozens of duplicates)

<buckley310> conversation is too long :o just partition the drive and be done with it. if you want to change the partition size, delete the backup, resize the partitions, and then immidiately re-backup
* rnabinger wishes `dump` was still a thing
<SuperficialyLost> hmm wpa_supplicant uses significant spaces in its config
<SuperficialyLost> mad shit
<rnabinger> SuperficialyLost: are you speaking to the significance of whitespace or the usage of whitespace?
<SuperficialyLost> rnabinger: the significance of whitespace ofcourse. All configs must do this*
<SgrA> I used to connect to a DHCP WiFi network. Due to some problems, the admin has changed the IP range but connman still tries to connect to the old IP.  It succeeds but I can't connect to the internet with that configuration. I'm on Arch linux and I managed to get it to work with netctl but connman still doesn't work.
<rnabinger> SuperficialyLost: in lua whitespace is basically insignificant
<grawity> SgrA: clear connman's DHCP leases
<rnabinger> SuperficialyLost: in C whitespace is insignificant
<grawity> though it really ought to do the same when it receives DHCPNAK
<SgrA> grawity: How?
<SuperficialyLost> rnabinger: I think richie made almost everything but simplicity significant in C
<rnabinger> SuperficialyLost: C is extremely simple, for what it does though
<SuperficialyLost> btw can I download a 86_64 package on a i686 system with pacman?
<rnabinger> SuperficialyLost: directly?
<SuperficialyLost> rnabinger: sorry you lost me...
<grawity> probably possible in an indirect way, but it won't be of much use to you
<SuperficialyLost> rnabinger: ah wait YES!
<schneid3306> My NTFS partitions are mounting in read only. I have ntfs-3g installed and I have rebooted since the install.
<rnabinger> http://archlinux.dynamict.se/$repo/os/$arch  for example
<sheep> schneid3306: how are you mounting them?
<SuperficialyLost> I need a quick fix for copying a tarball from pacman to a usb to transfer to get rfkill onto a non-networked system because rfkill isnt installed even tho wpa_supplicant is.. pheW
<SgrA> grawity: So no point?
<sheep> iirc you can interact with rfkill using sysfs and some echo and cat
<sheep> look under /sys/class/rfkill
<SuperficialyLost> sheep: really...
<cws> I've having some issues with removing Gnome. 
<cws> :: gtk3: removing adwaita-icon-theme breaks dependency 'adwaita-icon-theme'
<rnabinger> /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-rfkill
<cws> I forgot how to fix the dependency issue for the adwaita icon stuff.
<sheep> then do something like echo 0 > /sys/class/rfkill/rfkill0/soft
<rnabinger> sheep++
<SuperficialyLost> hmmm, hard says 0, soft says 0, state says 1
* SuperficialyLost logics off
* daey_ is now known as daey
<sheep> sounds like it's on
<sheep> there are probably other devices under /sys/class/rfkill though
<schneid3306> sheep: I think with read write. Here is a line from my fstab (all of the drives are mounted identically). /dev/sdb2       /mnt/plex/hd008 ntfs-3g rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,fmask=133,dmask=022   0    0
<SuperficialyLost> i have a recursive device in there
<rnabinger> curl https://ptpb.pw/kF2z  ... fwiw
<occultus> SuperficialyLost: both my devices say hard 0 soft 0 state 1 and they are powered on
<sheep> SuperficialyLost: that looks right except for maybe changing it a different user id
<SuperficialyLost> yet wpa_cli scan is producing no results, in an area that definately has results
<grawity> SuperficialyLost: sudo iw wlan0 scan
<rnabinger> SuperficialyLost: well, yeah more than rfkill is important
<SuperficialyLost> wow neighbour is piano'ing vivaldi
<rnabinger> ip li set up dev wlan0
<rnabinger> and IME, when a device comes back you should restart wpa_supplicant
<rnabinger> YMMV
<SuperficialyLost> rnabinger: nice that worked, sad enough
<rnabinger> SuperficialyLost: not sad, commonly forgotten
<SuperficialyLost> thanks, heres to never setting up network again
<rnabinger> SuperficialyLost: I suggest you enable config saving in wpa_supplicant.conf
<rnabinger> SuperficialyLost: and use wpa_gui and the save menu option
<rnabinger> SuperficialyLost: see https://ptpb.pw/qBM2 
<SuperficialyLost> okay, but is that really necessary?

<[fb]> verbose didn't show it
<rnabinger> --debug?
<[fb]> ty

<[fb]> it kept trying to get the .db files from the wrong url for that mirror
<[fb]> thank you for the help guys
<esph> [fb]: I highly recommend setting up a pacman hook to automatically update your mirrorlist with reflector: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Reflector
<phrik> Title: Reflector - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<[fb]> ty esph I will
<rnabinger> esph: ah yes I should do this too, I have a script I run that runs reflector to update /etc/pacman.d/reflector then sudo pacman -Syyuw --noconfirm
<schneid3306> I changed the permissions of the mount point to rw for everyone and the NTFS drives *still* will not mount as rw.
<rnabinger> schneid3306: no, do not do that
<rnabinger> schneid3306:  mountpoints are best left as root:root 0444
<schneid3306> ok.
<watered> how do I find out which graphic card I have using arch
<rnabinger> that way you don't accidently write stuff in there when its not mounted
<rnabinger> schneid3306: what does `mount | grep ntfs` show?
<schneid3306> nothing. they are mounting a fuseblk even though i have them as ntfs-3g in fstab
<rnabinger> schneid3306: what? ... if it is mounted then it should show up in /proc/mounts
<schneid3306> this is how the drives are mounting... /dev/sdd2 on /mnt/plex/hd005 type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other,blksize=4096)
<rnabinger> schneid3306: idk that doesn't sound right to me
<schneid3306> this is what my fstab looks like: /dev/sdd2     /mnt/plex/hd005 ntfs-3g rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,fmask=133,dmask=022     0       0
<rnabinger> /dev/sdb2 /mnt/2 fuseblk rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,allow_other,blksize=4096 0 0
<rnabinger> oh wtf that is right
<rnabinger> schneid3306: ls -ld /mnt/plex/hd005
<occultus> schneid3306: why don't you think it's mounted rw?
<rnabinger> schneid3306: because clear it is mounted rw
<schneid3306> because i cant do anything to it. i can't rename files. i can't delete files. i can't copy files. also..
<rnabinger> fmask=133,dmask=022
<occultus> schneid3306: you probably have to be root. see if root can modify files and if so, change... something about that setup
<rnabinger> user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other is what you need
<schneid3306> yeah that is on the fstab... also when in thunar or other file manager, the following is stated: access: read & write group: root (read only) others: read only
<schneid3306> okay i thnk i have all that i will add the user id=0 and groupid=0 to the fstab and reboot
<rnabinger> fmask=133,dmask=022 this is what is killing you
<rnabinger> reboot?  thats crazy talk
<schneid3306> aah okay i read that on debain? or something else
<rnabinger> man umask
<rnabinger> man ntfs-3g
<occultus> schneid3306: is this an existing windows disk or a data drive or what?
<schneid3306> yeah an existing windows data drive with loads on it
<occultus> schneid3306: there's no nice way to make that user-writable and I personally wouldn't trust it too much
<rnabinger> schneid3306: its your fmask=133,dmask=022 ... man umask
<rnabinger> there is no nice secure way to have multiple users write to it enforcing acls
<rnabinger> other than that.  I write to mine just fine

<rnabinger> Antioch: if you use `file` you will see that most archlinux tools are bash
<watered> Well I'm trying to squeeze the maximum out of this low end laptop I have. I want to do it using arch (Only and only). I could just get windows but no, only arch. games seem to be running but gets all choppy. I was wondering if there is anything i can disable or possibly boot into the game?! :O so that it utilizes all the resources to it's maximum. game boosters seem to do this effeciently on windows.
<rnabinger> watered: you need to know how to profile your system if you plan to optimize your system
<rnabinger> I believe `perf` is what you seek
<rnabinger> ?perf
* rnabinger fails hard
<Antioch> rnabinger: neat, thanks. I've never edited the makepkg config file before, but does that line you pasted mean that color is enabled?
<rnabinger> Antioch: in mine, yes
<rnabinger> Antioch: read all the comments right before that line in the config
<rnabinger> g2g probably be back
<Antioch> rnabinger: thanks!
<Antioch> ?perf
<rnabinger> ?pkg perf
<evilgrawity> rnabinger: community/perf 4.9-1 (Linux kernel performance auditing tool)
<watered> rnabinger, :O profile meaning?
<rnabinger> you know ... profiling the operation of the system while in the game, in order to determine the bottlenecks
<jack_boss> maybe im bit forgetfull but iirc EFI specification said 512kib partitionw was enough and it could start at 0 right?
<poisonby> jack_boss: More like MB
<rnabinger> jack_boss: thats not true on both questions
<watered> rnabinger, seems like that changes from game to game.. anything generic I can try?
<rnabinger> watered: yeah perf
<jack_boss> hmm, i thought EFI doesn't need that reserved MBR space nor does it care
<jack_boss> so 512MiB is too small?
<jack_boss> because i thought it was ok for an EFI partiton to start on sector 0, and i was thinking here fdisk is just a bitch
<watered> rnabinger, what do you mean perf?
<jack_boss> ok, lets skip that part, why is 2048 + 512 = 2560 not ok for last sector of partiton 1? or does it have to be 2560
<jack_boss> it wouldn't let me format it with mkfs.fat -F32 or F16 something about cluster size 
<jack_boss> *2561
<occultus> jack_boss: doesn't that make a 512 *byte* long partition?
<watered> Also there is a program on windows called throttle stopper for intel boards? It bypasses certain throttle controls. any such mechanisms for linux?
<occultus> jack_boss: or maybe KB or sectors, but those all sound too small
<jack_boss> ESP can be 512 MiB
<occultus> jack_boss: yeah, but 512 512-byte sectors = a 256-kilobyte ESP
<jack_boss> im totally having a brain fart here still clouded.. so i just did +512M haha
<jack_boss> 1024kib is 1Mib right.. lol
<jack_boss> i need a new identiy here my name is tarnished
<SuperficialyLost> is there a way to get gdb to display registers after every step?
* SuperficialyLost gives jack_boss some shoe polish

<SuperficialyLost> yeah well
<watered> can I install windows drivers for graphics card on linux?

<Elronnd> why can't I use xrandr --gama 1:1:0 to remove all blue light from the screen?
<sheep> Elronnd: it might need to be xrandr --output blah --gamma 1:1:0
<rnabinger> Elronnd: cause you mispelled gamma?
<Elronnd> sheep: nah, I'm already doing that
<rnabinger> Elronnd: xgamma can adjust the gamma relatively and per-color if you are interested
<Elronnd> rnabinger: thanks
<rnabinger> /usr/bin/xgamma is owned by xorg-xgamma 1.0.6-1
<rnabinger> woah, this perf tool is pretty sweet
<Elronnd> I still can't set any of the values to 0 though
<Elronnd> rnabinger: which perf tool?
<rnabinger> ?pkg perf
<evilgrawity> rnabinger: community/perf 4.9-1 (Linux kernel performance auditing tool)
<Elronnd> rnabinger: looks like xgamma doesn't coexist with xrandr --brightness
<rnabinger> Elronnd: check dmesg after you try to change that.  chances are your card cannot set the gamma to 0
<rnabinger> Elronnd: no ... gamma and brightness are not the same thing
<Elronnd> rnabinger: that's a message from xgamma, not an issue where the right thing isn't set
<Elronnd> rnabinger: no, I want to set both at the same time.  A lower brightness and a different gamma
<rnabinger> Elronnd: okay, brightness and gamma setting is not supported on all drivers ... it may only be supported on intels
<rnabinger> Elronnd: (i mean through those tools)
<Elronnd> well, here's what happens
<Elronnd> if I set a gamma, the brightness gets reset to 1
<Elronnd> if I then set a brightness then the gamma gets reset to the default 1:1:!
<Elronnd> s/!//g
<Elronnd> err
<Elronnd> s/!/1/g
<rnabinger> Elronnd: well like I said, xgamma only works for intel i believe.
<Elronnd> xgamma works fine
<fishbulb> hey I have to reinstall arch I think. if I copy the home directory, how much information does that contain that will be updated or just "there" on the new install? I usually reinstall everything when I have to, like erase and reinstall
<sheep> you'll need to make sure that the UIDs for the new system's users match the ones on the old system
<light> If the home directory is on another partition you don't even have to copy it.
<fishbulb> it's not on another partition, I hvae 4 partitions
<rnabinger> Elronnd: https://ptpb.pw/6169
<light> Perhaps a good idea for this install then
<fishbulb> I'd have to change all partitions
<rnabinger> Elronnd: see if you can set those
<rnabinger> fishbulb: well your home directory isn't really managed by arch .... so ... nothing?
<Elronnd> is there a difference between cat and catv?
<rnabinger> yeah
<rnabinger> catv is something I made
<rnabinger> if interested .... https://ptpb.pw/V_4I
<Elronnd> I get 3 "937"s, newline-separated
<rnabinger> Elronnd: catv just makes my life easier.  you can just cat the file and echo into the file
<Elronnd> so I can just write to /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness to set brightness in hardware?
<Elronnd> awesome!!
<rnabinger> Elronnd: yeah probably you can do this
<SuperficialyLost> heh
<rnabinger> Elronnd: yes you should explore /sys sometime ... it is amazing
<Elronnd> rnabinger: not right now though...right now I'm tired and looking for a way to decrease the screen brightness
<rnabinger> Elronnd: sudo sh -c 'echo 5 >/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness'
<Elronnd> rnabinger: yeah, I wrote a script to automate the process with a 0-1 brightness level
<rnabinger> backlight() { sudo sh -c 'echo '${1:?usage}'>/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness' ; }

<jvtbatman> Hey, I'm using urxvt and when I installed google-chrome my terminal font got fucked up. Each character now is wide like 3 chars. Didn't help to uninstall chrome, any ideas?
<rnabinger> watered: if you like tuning this is a place to spend time in
<watered> cool
<poisonby> jvtbatman: Which font are you using in urxvt?
<jvtbatman> poisonby: A modded Source Code Pro called Office Code Pro
<jvtbatman> But it seems the font is reset to some non-monospace font
<rnabinger> watered: Your memory remains static yes, as memory for hardware can't increase unless you buy better hardware. However there is used ram for your cpu and gpu, and ram that remains unused by the gpu and is set by default to the cpu when needed. For systems that are not cpu limited, this method takes ram "dedicated to being undedicated and used for the cpu" and allows the gpu to use it. You're correct as you
<rnabinger> can't create ram, this just optimizes the ram you have for the limitations in your system.Ôªø
<poisonby> jvtbatman: it's in fc-list right?

<alwyn> Hi, what's an easy way to configure WiFi? I'm using wpa_supplicant right now but tbh it's too much hassle.
<rnabinger> alwyn: wpa_supplicant works great
<rnabinger> alwyn: what is your problem?
<alwyn> rnabinger: I can't for the love of Bob not connect to my iPhone's hotspot. First it was an issue with a character that was not ' nor ¬¥ so I had to find the hex value and print that with echo... When that didn't work I renamed the hotspot but it still doesn't work
<alwyn> In any case I've been fiddling with this for way too long now...
<jvtbatman> https://ptpb.pw/xw5y
<rnabinger> alwyn: did you try wpa_gui?
<alwyn> If I had that installed :)
<poisonby> jvtbatman: 404
<alwyn> But I'll do that now, I'm connected to my Android's hotspot which works out of the box v0v
<poisonby> alwyn: networkmanager is an option, with nm-applet
<poisonby> If you want a gUI
<poisonby> GUI
<binaryplease> Hi I installed caja and caja-open-terminal. I have the button to "open terminal here" but nothing happens when I click it. How do I find the problem?
<poisonby> binaryplease: run caja from the terminal and see if it outputs anything. Other than that, no idea
<rnabinger> alwyn: wpa_gui makes it easy to setup a new SSID
<binaryplease> poisonby: No output :S
<rnabinger> alwyn: if you have update_config=1 in your wpa_supplicant.conf then you can also save that config
<jvtbatman> poisonby: https://ptpb.pw/xw5Y
<rnabinger> alwyn: there are programs that make it even "easier" but the reality is they just drive wpa_supplicant
<rnabinger> and wpa_gui has everything you need
<alwyn> rnabinger: I got wpa_gui now, when I click "scan" nothing happens.
<poisonby> jvtbatman: Yeah man that looks weird, try another monospaced font and see if that works
<rnabinger> alwyn: show me `ip li sh`
<alwyn> hurrdurr nvm I had the wrong adapter selected (p2p-dev-wlan0 as opposed to just wlan0)
<rnabinger> alwyn: cool, IDK if dhcpcd is triggered by wpa_supplicant by default or if I have to confiugre that too
* rnabinger thinks it should be default
<alwyn> brb
<alwyn> ping
<alwyn> It doesn't seem to work.
<jvtbatman> poisonby: Changing font in the config file makes no difference
<rnabinger> alwyn: show me `ip li sh`
<poisonby> jvtbatman: xrdb?
<alwyn> rnabinger: the event log tells me "4-Way Handshake failed - pre-shared key may be incorrect"
<rnabinger> alwyn: pretty self-explanatory
<alwyn> They key is very correct though
<alwyn> I triple checked and then typed it in again just in case :(
<rnabinger> alwyn: okay, then set the hotspot to have lowest form of encryption
<alwyn> haha
<rnabinger> alwyn: and change the SSID to myssid
<alwyn> It's an iPhone, you don't get that freedom
<rnabinger> alwyn: you can play with the type of encryption with wpa_gui
<rnabinger> alwyn: Manage Networks, select the entry, click edit
<rnabinger> alwyn: also, be sure that _you_ are not the 4th-way in that handshake (does your device ask you to authorize the laptop?)
<watered> rnabinger, so how do i implement the same comands in linux?
* cutgah1 is now known as cutgah
<rnabinger> watered: what are you talking about?
<watered> the video above... making more gpu dedicated
<rnabinger> watered: you can't ... your card has what it has
<rnabinger> just like your harddrive has what it has
<watered> I mean whatever the guy was doing in the video
<watered> I mean dedicating more ram for gpu.. maximum that i can
<watered> it's integrated card
<rnabinger> im not gonna spend 5 minutes on it
<rnabinger> watered: what that guy is doing is misguided
<rnabinger> stop trying to optimize things by going on irc
<rnabinger> watered: /pros/sys and /sys are how you tune everything
<rnabinger> watered: there is the archwiki and google
<alwyn> rnabinger: I don't see any authorization requests anywhere. When I connect my android phone to the hotspot it works fine.
<rnabinger> alwyn: :-(
<rnabinger> alwyn: start googling methinks a lot of people have iphones and wpa_supplicant
<alwyn> rnabinger: tried different protocols but no juice. It's most definitely not TKIP. Fairly sure it's CCMP if I look at the scan log. Tried WPA2-Personal and Enterprise but no juice...
<rnabinger> anything in dmesg?
<rnabinger> sorry guys I gotta sleep.  wish you the best of luck
* anirban_ is now known as anirban
<jvtbatman> poisonby: Can't really figure out what to do with xrdb?
<alwyn> No juice.
<alwyn> Nothing in dmesg
<poisonby> jvtbatman: I mean, did you xrdb ~/.Xresources after setting a new font?
<alwyn> What's the easiest to configure way wpa_supplicant?
<alwyn> A wrapper is fine
<alwyn> it just needs to work
<alwyn> I can't do my work like this

<Tahvok> Hey guys!
<pfad> sup man
<Tahvok> I would like to receive a recommendation. I'm maintaining the following aur: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gridcoinresearch-qt
<phrik> Title: AUR (en) - gridcoinresearch-qt (at aur.archlinux.org)
<Tahvok> It builds 2 packages 'gridcoinresearch-qt' and 'gridcoinresearchd'. Some users are requesting that I split it into to separate aur. Now I would like to know how to make it the most transparent way
<beest> Tahvok: are these separate upstream?
<rnabinger> Tahvok: if it builds two packages then you should have two PKGBUILDs imo
<rnabinger> Tahvok: but if its big it may make sense to build both in one run
<beest> since this is a split package, if you separate the daemon in the aur and give the qt client the same name with a depend on the daemon it will pull in both packages anyway on upgrade
<rnabinger> beest__
* rnabinger failed
<Tahvok> rnabinger: what do you mean by big?
<rnabinger> Tahvok: long time to biuld
<Tahvok> It is long time, and that is the reason they request to split it. You don't need both of them, you need just one.
<earnestly> MindfulMonk: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/5083/files
<phrik> Title: hwdb: Include X220 for pointingstick sensitivity by Earnestly ¬∑ Pull Request #5083 ¬∑ systemd/systemd ¬∑ GitHub (at github.com)
<rnabinger> Tahvok: yeah, you should split it if the daemon builds significantly faster than the -tq
<Tahvok> You choose to run either the daemoen (gridcoinresearchd) or the qt gui
<rnabinger> err -qt
<beest> Tahvok: oh, so the qt package isn't just a client for gridcoinresearchd
<rnabinger> Tahvok:  -qt depends on daemon.
<Tahvok> In aur, it already has a base, which is split into 2 packages: https://aur.archlinux.org/pkgbase/gridcoinresearch/
<phrik> Title: AUR (en) - gridcoinresearch (at aur.archlinux.org)
<rnabinger> is there a point to just installing the daemon?
<earnestly> MindfulMonk: Well this: https://ptpb.pw/_Qdt
<Tahvok> rnabinger: qt does NOT depend on daemon. You shouldn't run both of them!
<Tahvok> You choose what you want
<rnabinger> Tahvok: oh then yeah two packages
<Tahvok> The daemon, provide a cli for non gui operation.
<earnestly> MindfulMonk: Since you can't access that serio sensitivity thing via udev at boot
<beest> and add conflicts
<Tahvok> The qt has a daemon of it's own
<rnabinger> Tahvok: both provide the same thing
<rnabinger> yeah super clear you need two PKGBUILDS
<Tahvok> Well yeah, the original maintainer did it in one PKGBUILD, and I just took over it..
<rnabinger> pacman -Ss transmission
<beest> or if they don't share binary names there's no point to even conflicts
<beest> just split them up and let the end-user deal with the vestigial package

<MrElendig> bleb: user error
<elsewho> bleb, kernel update?
<MrElendig> bleb: reboot

<earnestly> wyre: I suppose you've tried all the tools easily available and none of them worked?
<codfection> Idk how to provide more info. opening chrome from dmenu took 5 mins :| 
<daey> you can start building from this while :; ping -c1 google.com > log.log; sleep 1; done
<daey> you can start building from this while :; do ping -c1 google.com > log.log; sleep 1; done

<ishitatsuyuki> And get a captcha
<daey> yeah if he needs millisecond precision its not the way to go. but considering that he didnt specify it...
<earnestly> daey: ping is icmp, which is not exactly a great thing to measure, unless you're specifically measuring icmp
<daey> or connection in general
<earnestly> Also why execute ping multiple times?
<codfection> poisonby, ^
<daey> you can eval them individually and only write failures into the log
<earnestly> daey: What? no?
<daey> sure you can
<earnestly> No, what the fuck are you on about?
<earnestly> I'm so confused
<earnestly> ping doesn't need to be restarted multiple times to track errors

<DoctorJellyface> how can I find out why a specific package was installed?
<DoctorJellyface> i have a ton of kframework stuff on my laptop, all installed as a dependency and I have no idea what depends on them
<MrElendig> DoctorJellyface: -Qi, aka "man pacman"
<DoctorJellyface> MrElendig: that doesn‚Äôt help, it also says "installed as a dependency"
<wyre> beest, it was only necessary enable resolvd.service xD
<earnestly> There's also pactree
<MrElendig> DoctorJellyface: it also says "required by" if something still depends on it
<DoctorJellyface> earnestly: didn‚Äôt help either
<MrElendig> DoctorJellyface: if not then it is an orphan
<earnestly> Fuck it then
<earnestly> Donesn't work, doesn't work, doesn't work.  Well better install something else then
<DoctorJellyface> MrElendig: the problem is that it‚Äôs a whole group of packages
<MrElendig> if it is an orphan then you can read your pacman log and possibly be able to reason about what once depended on it
<earnestly> DoctorJellyface: Doesn't help
<beest> wyre: please read the wiki more carefully next time
<DoctorJellyface> MrElendig: good idea, I haven‚Äôt though of that
<DoctorJellyface> earnestly: what‚Äôs the matter with you?
<DoctorJellyface> I‚Äôm not one to give up this easily
<DoctorJellyface> I‚Äôve already killed like 10 minutes on it so better finish it
<earnestly> DoctorJellyface: Really, what's the matter with you?  If people give you suggestions, you don't simply say "nope", you explain why.  There are many ways to figure this out but you shit on all of them without reason
<wyre> beest, you are right :) 
<earnestly> DoctorJellyface: pactree for example, is not exactly the most approachable tool unless you use the right flags, do you mention those.  Nope
<earnestly> DoctorJellyface: In the end, you can just try removing those packages and pacman will tell you what it depends on
<DoctorJellyface> earnestly: I just noped it because I did all I could, everything you mentioned, I was just wondering if I missed something
<earnestly> If you have orphans, you can list those too
<earnestly> DoctorJellyface: If you *DID* those things, why didn't you *MENTION* it?
<pfad> tadpoles
<DoctorJellyface> earnestly: I already removed several packages and all orphans several times during the hunt
<DoctorJellyface> earnestly: I would, but I spent all the time here typing, literally
<earnestly> DoctorJellyface: Again, we can't crystal ball these things, so without mentioning what you've done, we're wasting our time on your behalf retreading the same things.  Great
<DoctorJellyface> cause the first reply I got was RTFM

<Kilobyte22> if i have a pkgbuild and want to use a git repo as source but that repo needs to be accessed using ssh, how'd i do that
<Kilobyte22> (the pkgbuild is for personal use only)
<earnestly> Kilobyte22: Prefix the source url with git+
<MrElendig> ssh+....
<MrElendig> man PKGBUILD
<Kilobyte22> ah okay
<earnestly> MrElendig: There's no ssh+ protocol handler
<earnestly> But git understands ssh urls, simply tell makepkg that the url should be handled by git
<pfad> actually, thanks for bringing pactree up
<MrElendig> yea I ment git

<xelra> Which package gets me the rename command that is much more powerful? The one I have is an oversimplified stub. I need the one that does all the substitutions, has the -N option for counting and more imporantly has --dry-run.
<Namarrgon> perl-rename
<xelra> Thanks.
<DoctorJellyface> earnestly, MrElendig: I finally found the cause. Looks like they were all just dependant on each other in one giant dependency mess, removing one removed all the others, none of them were explicitely installed
<MrElendig> if it was an actual group: pacman -Ru whatever
<earnestly> There seems to be more and more dependency cycles creeping into [extra].  It used to just be harfbuzz and freetype2 (this was a known thing).  Then came yp-tools and ytbind-mt, now there's like 4 more!
<DoctorJellyface> earnestly: I apologize if I came as I didn‚Äôt appreciate your advice, I honestly didn‚Äôt want to sound like that
<earnestly> kinit and kio, python{2}-twisted and python{2}-incremental, and usbmuxd and libimobiledevice

<earnestly> And now there's dependency cycles in community too
<DoctorJellyface> earnestly: actually I‚Äôm quite angry with myself because this happens more than it should and I never realise, thankfully it isn‚Äôt nearly as bad in real life
<earnestly> DoctorJellyface: This is real life
<earnestly> Or am I a bot?  I don't know

<codfection> which pdf/epub reader do you guys use on arch? (its difficult to change night mode in zathura, have to manually edit config every time :( )
<vindur> Hi, I've been trying to set Chromium as my default browser and i3wm is my window manager.
<vindur> When I do "xgd-mime query default x-scheme-handler/http" it returns "userapp-Chromium-5XGORY.desktop" which looks correct.
<vindur> But Chromium prompts me to set as default everytime.
<codfection> vindur, write "echo $BROWSER"
<codfection> and give us output
<vindur> Returns nothing
<codfection> thats why.
<vindur> I thought that wasn't for GUI apps though?
<codfection> just write $BROWSER

<dandels> So I got a new motherboard with a NIC that uses e1000e and I get a 10 year old "NVM checksum is not valid"-error. The workaround for e1000 appears to be modprobing with "eeprom_bad_csum_allow=1" but the e1000e module doesn't appear to have this option. Does anyone happen to have suggestions for this error, short of buying a new NIC or patching the source of the module?
<earnestly> Namarrgon: Good ban

<MoonGNatRouth> yeah. already found. thank you ;)
<MarcinWieczorek> Any idea?
<earnestly> Hello71: There is literally places on google telling you to use LC_ALL because it's less annoying than setting all the LC_ environments
<Namarrgon> MarcinWieczorek: move it out of the way and try again?

<earnestly> MarcinWieczorek: You probably don't need the : in the definition with macros
<lmat> earnestly: This doesn't work. lsblk suggests that /dev/sda5 is used for /dev/mapper/stephen-root; but findmnt -S /dev/sda5; returns nothing.
<earnestly> MarcinWieczorek: And you don't need * for that class either
<earnestly> lmat: lsblk reads udev (i.e. the kernel), not the actual disk

<Smither> Hey. I'm trying to get tinyos to work on my arch laptop, I have downloaded and installed tinyos and nesc from source, but when i try to make and make install i am missing the ncc program. it is referenced in the ubuntu man pages but I can't workout where the source code is or how to install it. any one else used tinyos and know how to do this?
<MarcinWieczorek> It used to work fine.
<earnestly> Smither: Why are you using make install... ;(
<lmat> earnestly: I originally asked: "How can I be sure /dev/sdd isn't being used" it looks like findmnt is not a safe way to do that in the face of lvm (or probably mdadm? and no telling what other utilities) :-)
<Smither> well it actually fails before that. it fails on the make stage.
<earnestly> lmat: You didn't ask that
<lmat> :'(
<earnestly> lmat: you didn't even mention lvm (or DM devices)
<earnestly> MarcinWieczorek: Sure it willw ork, but you don't /need/ it.  Gosh, xresources sure is cargo-culted
<lmat> earnestly: I think your answer was correct.  "How do I tell where a device is mounted?" "findmnt".  I *should* have asked: "How can I tell if a device is being used?"
<MarcinWieczorek> earnestly: thanks for the advice.
<earnestly> lmat: If you want a general mechanism, basically lsof
* zerick_ is now known as zerick
<earnestly> lmat: Again, because you didn't mention DMs
<earnestly> But not really even
<earnestly> lmat: Because it can be mounted and unused
<earnestly> lmat: And then you even involve namespaces, and your question quickly boils down to meaningless.  This is the /primary/ reason why vague, general "y" questions are such a pain the in arse
<earnestly> lmat: So instead, just ask the real question, first, always
<earnestly> ... I wonder if trying to use flock -x on a device block would work
<ishmael> earnestly: i think a lot of people have a really hard time identifying the issue they're having. they have so many assumptions that theyre unaware of
<ishmael> i think that when someone asks a bad question, their implied question (that they dont even know they need to ask) is, canyou help me figure out what im talking about here?
<earnestly> ishmael: On the contrary, xy problems usually result from them thinking they /do/ know what the problem is, and asking about issues they're having their path of logic towards their solution
<Smither> I'm having problems with tinyos and nesc. I have installed tinyos and nesc from source as described here-> http://tinyos.stanford.edu/tinyos-wiki/index.php/Installing_From_Source  but when i try make the Null app it fails, see the log here-> https://ptpb.pw/06ve  I have looked for how to install the ncc program and the only thing i can find is on the ubuntu forums here->
<Smither> http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/ncc.1.html    but I can't work out where to get it from
<phrik> Title: Installing From Source - TinyOS Wiki (at tinyos.stanford.edu)
<phrik> Title: Ubuntu Manpage: ncc - nesC compiler for TinyOS (at manpages.ubuntu.com)
<earnestly> ishmael: But it's a paradox
<ishmael> earnestly: right, that's what im saying. that theyre making assumptions of which theyre unaware
<earnestly> ishmael: It would be much easier to be honest though, no thinking required :D
<earnestly> ?pkgfile ncc
<evilgrawity> earnestly: no results for 'ncc'
<earnestly> Smither: You'll have to find out where you can get this ncc tool from

<tempnick> grazzolini: The 4TB *is* my backup drive! And my 1TB backup of my 4TB backup drive doesn't have my treasures on it! :((

<grazzolini> tempnick: not really
<Keziolio> it's the second time something like this happens in a few days
<Namarrgon> Keziolio: pacman -Q opencollada
<Keziolio> last time was another library
<Keziolio> opencollada 20150702-3
<Keziolio> i wrote that in the report
<Scimmia> Keziolio: I was just looking at that. The path to the library is added to the linker's path in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencollada.conf
<tempnick> grazzolini: You're quite familiar with LUKS lvm crypto and such? Certain my disk is screwed? Nothing I can do? Trying to figure out if I should, stop trying.
<earnestly> MarcinWieczorek: Anyway, the problem actually jsut seems like you forgot to load the new xresources
<earnestly> Messed up somewhere, because the cpp didn't run
<grazzolini> tempnick: no, I'm not certain. but, if you can't read from your disk, you're pretty much screwed

<Namarrgon> Keziolio: works for me
<tempnick> grazzolini: this tool 'testdisk' can work my disk over checking it. So, it's not mechanical, perhaps... Just partition screw up-y maybe?
<Scimmia> Keziolio: the library is at /usr/lib/opencollada/libOpenCOLLADAStreamWriter.so. The file I mentioned tells the linker to look in that dir
<Keziolio> Namarrgon: opencollada: 364 total files, 0 altered files
<Keziolio> Scimmia: ah ok i wasn't finding it in /usr/lib
<tempnick> earnestly: Hmm... If I conspire to commit some terror maybe my local intelligence agency will give me a hand.
<Scimmia> Keziolio: run ldconfig as root, see if there's any errors
<earnestly> Keziolio: ldconfig -p | less /libOpenCOLLADA
<grazzolini> tempnick: without your partition table you could still theoretically recover your data using your luks header
<crobbins__> i'm having trouble figuring out how to route traffic through my command line vpn client, openconnect, is there a wiki for this already?>
<earnestly> Or I guess you can skip checking and just rebuild the ld cache
* crobbins__ is now known as crobbins
<Keziolio> Scimmia: no output
<earnestly> tempnick: Except they can't either
<grazzolini> tempnick: and, the header might still be there, if it's just the gpt that's missing
<Keziolio> earnestly: /libOpenCOLLADA: No such file or directory 
<crobbins> using nm-applet, but configuring vpn through it probably won't work well since i have to steal a cookie to auth with vpn
<earnestly> Keziolio: / is a search command in less
<earnestly> Keziolio: Better than grep for interactive searching
<tempnick> gdisk output wrote something about being able to maybe recreate the gpt from... hmm... written down...
<earnestly> tempnick: gpt stores backup headers for its partition table, but that's not related to luks
<earnestly> Yetanotherfuckingpastebinthatneedsjstodisplaytext
<tempnick> grazzolini && earnestly: Advancing the topic, I've researched 100K ways to do easy home backups, no cloud. How do you do your backups? I hate this. :(
<earnestly> tempnick: Yeah, you've lost it.  Don't worry, everyone skips doing backups until they've lost something they care about
<Keziolio> earnestly: grep with "COLLADA" gives no output
<earnestly> (Also, encryption sucks for this reason as well, and why I don't use it if I can avoid it)
<earnestly> Keziolio: Then what Scimmia said
<tempnick> Lost tons of SANS SEC courses... Those are the most prized things I've lost. :/
<grazzolini> tempnick: I use duplicity
<grazzolini> tempnick: but, I also have RAID on my luks encrypted devices
<Keziolio> /usr/lib/opencollada is already in that file
<tempnick> duplicity. I'll research that top to bottom. Thanks. Plus RAID LUKS. Okay...
<earnestly> tempnick: Or just skip LUKS, if you can
<tempnick> So... is the drive toast? As in, recycle bin?
<earnestly> Encrypt only the things that need to be encrypted with something like gpg
<earnestly> tempnick: The drive is fine
<grazzolini> tempnick: I don't know
<tempnick> Yeah, I think after so many total data losses it might be time for me to stop using disk crypto.
<grazzolini> I can't be sure by the information you provided
<Scimmia> Keziolio: do you have something in the env overriding the linker paths?
<grazzolini> tempnick: lol, sure, blame the crypto for not having backups =D
<earnestly> tempnick: Someone did a cost analysis of disk encryption due to all the work that gets lost due to corruption, can't remember it now, or find it
<tempnick> So a good 'ol /sbin/mkdosfs -F32 -I /dev/sdb should do?
<tempnick> HAHAHAHAHA! Damn crypto, back up your crap!
<Keziolio> Scimmia: I don't think so as i tried in fish/bash/zsh
<Namarrgon> Keziolio: this is arch linux, right? not manjaro, parabola or somethinge else?
<grazzolini> Keziolio: well, you could still have something overriding the paths
<Keziolio> Namarrgon: arch
<earnestly> grazzolini: Yeah, stupid people for using openssl wrong.  They should have jsut learned the API properly.  It's always their fault and the designers of these systems should never take any ethical responsibility for humans.  Those guys in the Amazon space plane?  Yeah, they just did it wrong too
<Keziolio> grazzolini: ok I'll look into that
<earnestly> grazzolini: Welcome to why computer programming is not engineering

<Scimmia> yes, he did
<grazzolini> earnestly: I got some e-mails off list regarding LibreSSL
<Keziolio> ldconfig as root?
<Keziolio> I did that
<earnestly> Scimmia: Wouldn't they need to use -r / (since post install glibc uses -r .)
<earnestly> grazzolini: Anything promising?
<Scimmia> just ldconfig should do it AFAIK
<tempnick> Thanks for the help earnestly & grazzolini. :)
<tempnick> exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
<Scimmia> earnestly: oh, -r is just used in case --root is used for pacman
<earnestly> Scimmia: It is optional at least, but would ldconfig use the current directory if -r wasn't specified?
<earnestly> Scimmia: Right
<Scimmia> earnestly: try it as non-root, it will fail with permission issues

<tempnick> Scimmia: The disk was LUKS encrypted and it's all screwed up, apparently unrecoverable.
<Keziolio> Namarrgon: tried now and it has the same problem
<tempnick> Erm, how can/should I format the disk?
<grazzolini> earnestly: on the contrary
<Keziolio> is there a way to reset everything?
<Scimmia> tempnick: generally you don't. You format the partition on the disk
<Scimmia> tempnick: check fdisk -l

<Namarrgon> why are you trying to format a broken device? and with fat32 at that
<tempnick> So it *is* broken?
<MrElendig> tempnick: what was on that thing before?
<MrElendig> and what kind of device is this?
<MrElendig> also why are you using /sbin/ ?
<tempnick> MrElendig: 4TB drive with tons of material from SANS.org... :( and all of my other nice things.
<Scimmia> Keziolio: sanity check: what does `file /usr/bin/blender` say?
<Scimmia> tempnick: you can dd out the first MB or two of the drive, that should let you start over
<Scimmia> dd zeros to it, that is
<tempnick> sudo dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/sdb ^C ?
<Scimmia> still not sure why dmesg would report that capacity, though; not sure where it comes from
<MrElendig> how is it connected?
<Scimmia> tempnick: I would use /dev/zero
<MrElendig> and what is the actual problem?

* MrElendig suggest taking the drive out and connecting it directly over sata
<tempnick> MrElendig: hahaha, I uhh, had to connect it this way otherwise, though my BIOS would detect it, the OS would not.
<MrElendig> then trow it in the trash
<Namarrgon> plug it into a different system, if it still says that the capacity is 32 exabyte then you know somehting's wrong
<tempnick> Though... I could try leaving it connected to the motherboard/power supply and disconnecting/reconnecting the sats cable while the OS is running.
<tempnick> Nah, the data's dead. Can the drive be used again though? It's 4TB and not but years old!
<MrElendig> tempnick: rma it then and get a new one
<Scimmia> Keziolio: that looks fine, then how about `file /usr/lib/opencollada/libOpenCOLLADAStreamWriter.so`?

<buckley310> failing an RMA, theres a good chance the drive is fine and the adapter is bad
<tempnick> buckley310: via usb adapter yes
<Keziolio> Namarrgon: plenty of files in /etc/profile.d/
<Namarrgon> did you edit any of them or add new ones?
<MrElendig> buckley310: he said it failed when connected directly over sata
<tempnick> BIOS detected the drive on boot, OS did not detect.
<Keziolio> Namarrgon: not manually, do you have some pacman magic command to check?
<Keziolio> I brutally moved /usr/lib/opencollada in /usr/lib/ and it works
<buckley310> ah, nvm then :)

<murkx> hi, is there a way to remove borders and all window-decoration of specific programs (Xorg)? (in my case mpv)
<bbigras> docker seems usable now. I purged every docker directories and reinstalled.
<murkx> (using bspwm ^^)
<cudencuden> I am following pulse audio troubleshooting wiki but have a question about: If the only playback device is the Dummy Output, PulseAudio cannot access your sound devices. It is possible there is an issue with logind giving permissions
<gtxbb> pulseaudio needs sinks -- so if you want pulseaudio, you will need to make sure it is using an alsa sink
<cudencuden> further instruction say, if loginctl show-session $XDG_SESSION_ID does not show correct output then i need to make sure that X runs on the same tty where the login occurred. This is required in order to preserve the logind session. 
<thurstylark> cudencuden: do you have pulseaudio-alsa installed?
<cudencuden> i just installed pusleaudio-alsa, pulseaudio volume control still only dummy output
<cudencuden> how do i make sure i am using alsa sink?
<poisonby> murkx: I use bspwm too, should do it automatically
<thurstylark> cudencuden: try relog or reboot
<cudencuden> copy that.
<murkx> poisonby: what do you mean? when i use mpv --no-border it still has a border (i use compton as a compositor tho)
<cudencuden> @thurstylank, still only dummy out device
<cudencuden> *rk
<poisonby> murkx: set up a rule with border=off
<thurstylark> cudencuden: can you paste the output of `fuser -v /dev/snd/*`
<cudencuden> it is nothign. returns nothing
<murkx> poisonby: thanks, i will try that, didn't know that option existed ^^
<cudencuden> aplay -l says no sound card found
<cudencuden> nvm, if i run as root i do see my soundcard
<murkx> poisonby: thanks man, it works great
<thurstylark> cudencuden: can you paste that output to a paste service?
<thurstylark> !paste

<poisonby> murkx: Nice! No problem

<thurstylark> weird. your sound devices aren't world rw...
<thurstylark> hmm. guess mine aren't either, but I can still see and use them just fine
<cudencuden> what is world rw?also, jack says installed but not running. is that normal?
<thurstylark> cudencuden: jack being installed shouldn't interfere with anything. When I say world rw, I'm saying /dev/snd/* isn't readable or writable by others.
<PatrolDoom> thurstylark: pencils don't use speakers to write silly
<MacGyver> thurstylark: Actually, jack being installed *does* interfere.
<thurstylark> orly?
<MacGyver> Depending on whether it's *really* not running.
<MacGyver> It steals your cards, so it might very well be the cause of not seeing them in pulse.
<thurstylark> hmm
<MacGyver> cudencuden: Can you verify jack is really not running?
<cudencuden> sorry, i'm very new. how to verify if jack is really not running?
<thurstylark> `pgrep -a jack` most likely
<MacGyver> Yeah, that ^
<cudencuden> i get no result doing pgrep -a jack
<meurer> When writing a pacman hook how could I make the Exec line substitute $USER to the actual user as intended?
<MacGyver> Okay, then jack isn't interfering. Carry on.
<MacGyver> meurer: Why do you want something user-specific in a pacman hook?
<MacGyver> meurer: i.e. what are you actually trying to do?
<meurer> MacGyver, I'm writing a hook that does a sed to replace the user on a certain file. I want it to be portable without me having to mess with it, so I wanted sed to replace the old user with the current $USER
<meurer> I guess I could just hardwire my username there, but I figured a portable solution would be more elegant 
<kaleidoscope> !ugm
<phrik> Good (ugt) morning to all from kaleidoscope!
<MacGyver> Using pacman for user-specific configuration is usually frowned upon, considering it's the package manager for a multi-user system.
<MacGyver> Hmm.
<kaleidoscope> hey guys, can you guys help me setup openvpn with connman? i'm using connman-gtk and i'm not connecting to any of PIA's servers
<kaleidoscope> the connman-vpn is started as well.
<meurer> MacGyver, Well, I'll just use my username then
<kaleidoscope> the gui says it connects and they "fails" (as in reverts back to idle) without causing any change
<kaleidoscope> i can use openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/client/*** but i was hoping to let connman deal with the setup
<makmm> Sound doesnt work... using a fresh install with xfce & gdm
<poisonby> makmm: So what are you using?
<makmm> poisonby, nothing..? it worked out-of-the-box on other install i did
<cudencuden> markmm, i am using lxde and no sound either
<poisonby> makmm: So you're only using alsa?
<makmm> poisonby, i installed pulseaudio
<poisonby> makmm: So you're using pulesaudio?
<makmm> poisonby: i guess..?
<poisonby> makmm: Don't guess. Are you using it or not?
<lounge> Hi ,to write protect resolv.conf is chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf ,whats command to un protect?
<makmm> poisonby: yes... i didnt install alsa or anything else than pulseaudio and pavucontrol
<poisonby> makmm: Pavucontrol works? Nothing is muted, etc.?
<makmm> poisonby: nope.
<kaleidoscope> lounge: replace the + to -
<poisonby> makmm: Does pavucontrol show feedback when you listen to audio?
<makmm> poisonby: yes
<kaleidoscope> with sudo of course
<poisonby> makmm: Can you check for muted channels in alsa-mixer?
<poisonby> alsamixer*
<makmm> poisonby: so i install it?
<lounge> kaleidosc: thanks ,ofcourse :>
<kaleidoscope> lounge: sure thing :)
<poisonby> makmm: it's in extra/alsa-utils
<poisonby> makmm: If alsamixer doesn't fix your problem, consider trying fluxbox or something just to make sure it's not LXDE that's causing it, since that other guy had the same problem
<makmm> poisonby: how do i use alsamixer? ui is werid
<makmm> weird*
<thurstylark> makmm: left/right changes which fader you're controlling, m toggles mute, f6 allows you to change the sound card you're controlling
<poisonby> ^
<poisonby> makmm: Check for muted channels.
<poisonby> Muted = MM in alsamixer IIRC
<thurstylark> yup
<makmm> poisonby: unmuted the muted ones, nothing...
<poisonby> makmm: Still not working? Try the audio in fluxbox or something then to make sure it's not LXDE itself
<makmm> poisonby: xfce*
<poisonby> Right
<poisonby> :P
<makmm> poisonby: speaker-test does nothing...
* poisonby tried speaker-test, RIP ears
<makmm> poisonby: :/
<AzumaHazuki> speaker-test -t sine -f 250 is nicer
<poisonby> But yeah then I'm out of ideas unfortunately
<poisonby> makmm: I assume you've set the correct default output device in pavucontrol?
<makmm> poisonby: im pretty sure my headphones there dont come up
<poisonby> makmm: Really? USB or AUX?
<makmm> poisonby: AUX

<Boobuigi> NTFS bullshit is the best way to start off a Monday.
<makmm> poisonby: going to restart to see if it works, see you on the other side?
<AzumaHazuki> i had an idea. frontend for Connmann called Conneries. It blasphemes in Quebecois whenever your connection drops :v
<makmm> poisonby: it worked! thanks!
<dviola> what's a fast PDF viewer? chromium chokes a bit with PDF containing 8000 pages or more
<AzumaHazuki> and if you pull the ethernet cable it shouts "Branleur!" at you through the speakers
<poisonby> makmm: Nice! No problem
<citazen> so tell me again why i dont want a cron job to run my update command?
<dviola> I'll give mupdf a try
<thurstylark> citazen: because you're supposedly not a masochist
<citazen> wh? dafq
<Infamous> thurstylark, lold
<thurstylark> citazen: because sometimes updates require manual intervention, and if you do updates automatically, you won't know when that is and breakage will happen
<petejones> when i update mpv-git, i get this in the beginning: WARNING: Using existing $srcdir/ tree. any significance?
<poisonby> citazen: Can you stop trolling?
<petejones> i think it started a couple days ago
<thurstylark> citazen: but because the instructions/notification for such a situation is in the output of pacman, and it's a reasonable assumption that you're actually *reading* that output, the breakage is now your fault.
<citazen> hmmm. so could have a terminal just open and run the command, this way i can monitor and interact?
<poisonby> citazen: Are you gonna make sure you're at the computer every time the commands runs out of your control?
<poisonby> Stop trolling... You're not funny.
<thurstylark> citazen: sure, but if it automatically pops up and runs pacman -Syu, and you stop the update, you're now in a partial upgrade situation, which is also not supported.
<citazen> ahhh u say if it does run and lets say i reboot atm then !linux... k
<thurstylark> citazen: you *could* just have something notify you with the output from checkupdates, then do the upgrade yourself if you choose to. That would keep things sane
<citazen> yeah maybe notifications. k ty
<petejones> anyone?
<Boobuigi> Weird.  Formatting a drive with mkfs.ntfs resulted in Windows not recognizing it, while parted resulted in a recognizable drive.
<thurstylark> Boobuigi: because parted and mkfs don't do the same job
<delmadord> Hello, I am building my second AUR package. The version of the original item is 2.1_RC1. Where to put _RC1 part into PKGBUILD (common practice), please?
<grazzolini> petejones: how are you updating
<petejones> grazzolini: pacaur
<Boobuigi> thurstylark: Durrr?
<thurstylark> Boobuigi: if that answer isn't sufficient, provide more details.
<grazzolini> petejones: try using the --rebuild option. but git packages should be built using --devel
* thurstylark gets that tattooed on his forhead
<grazzolini> petejones: or, better yet, makepkg
<petejones> grazzolini: my update command is pacaur -Syu --devel --needed
<poisonby> grazzolini: What does the --devel flag do? :o
<citazen> yaourt yaourt
<petejones> poisonby: updates git packages
<grazzolini> petejones: makepkf -sriC
<grazzolini> makepkg
<poisonby> Ohh, I assumed it was an argument of makepkg
<grazzolini> poisonby: no, pacaur's
<poisonby> Yeah, I see :P
<petejones> grazzolini: you're saying i should rebuild it with makepkg?
<grazzolini> petejones: or remove the cache from .cache/pacaur
<grazzolini> petejones: but yes, using makepkg is the only official way
<petejones> grazzolini: yeah I tried deleting the cache and rebuilding. TBH I doubt rebuilding with makepkg will matter since this just started happening but I guess I can try
<petejones> either way it doesnt actually affect the update or anything
<petejones> literally just a benign warning. makes me curious though.
<grazzolini> petejones: man makepkg. specifically the -C option
<d_garbage> always troubleshoot with the native tools
<grazzolini> petejones: it might
<petejones> fair enough, ill give it a shot
<petejones> grazzolini: so i should use makepkg -sriC?
<grazzolini> petejones: read makepkg man page and find out =D
<petejones> grazzolini: the rest of the process is the same right? just git clone etc
<petejones> okay okayyyyyyy
<grazzolini> petejones: at least I gave you the options you need
<grazzolini> petejones: there are days I don't even do half that =D
<d_garbage> i usually build with -sirc unless it's some kind of vcs thing
<petejones> grazzolini: yeah i appreciate it :)
<TheRealRob> Hi, I've a problem w/ bluetooth
<grazzolini> d_garbage: -C, not -c
<TheRealRob>  its always the same story, I get it to pair w/ my device, then about 1.2937867 seconds later, it says: [CHG] Device 54:79:75:7B:2D:27 ServicesResolved: no and [CHG] Device 54:79:75:7B:2D:27 Connected: no
<TheRealRob> then if I try and connect w/ it by "connect 54:79:75:7B:2D:27", then I get "Failed to connect: org.bluez.Error.Failed", and in the log I get bluetoothd[12199]: 54:79:75:7B:2D:27: error updating services: Device or resource busy (16)
<d_garbage> grazzolini, yes if it isn't clean already but mine already are :)
<d_garbage> i like the -c because i archive the last copy of each tarball/package and that saves some space
<TheRealRob> also, right at starting the bluetoothd daemon I get bluetoothd[12199]: Failed to obtain handles for "Service Changed" characteristic
<TheRealRob> has anybody had similar trouble w/ bluetooth?
<d_garbage> TheRealRob, paste (see topic) the full log
<Boobuigi> thurstylark: Nah, it was just an observation of mine.  Parted has "mkpart primary ntfs 0% 100%", which should produce the same results as "mkfs.ntfs /dev/selected_by_parted", but it doesn't.

<TheRealRob> systemd status log https://bpaste.net/show/dee389c30264
<phrik> Title: show at bpaste (at bpaste.net)
<petejones> grazzolini: So it didn't give me the warning when using makepkg but didn't make it stop happening with pacaur.
<d_garbage> TheRealRob, dunno what the problem is but "Unknown key AutoEnable in main.conf" sounds like you should check your config
<petejones> grazzolini: anyway whatever its probably a pacaur specific warning and it may even be caused by upstream
<grazzolini> petejones: because pacaur uses another dir
<petejones> grazzolini: ohhhh
<TheRealRob> ah ye, got that from the archwiki d_garbage, I can surely remove it
<citazen> !pacaur
<phrik> If you are not a makepkg wizard already, help yourself with the wiki and stay away from this helper!
<petejones> grazzolini: Isn't the source dir for pacaur in .cache?
<TheRealRob> https://bpaste.net/show/3f1c2abc2fb7 <- and thats bluetoothctl when I tryand use the device
<phrik> Title: show at bpaste (at bpaste.net)
<petejones> wait people say pacaur is bad now?
<grazzolini> petejones: usually, yes
<petejones> my god
<grazzolini> petejones: no, citazen is a troll
<poisonby> ^
<petejones> grazzolini: oh ok
<poisonby> Fucking hate that guy
<poisonby> Though I have noticed a bit of resentment towards pacaur
<poisonby> Lately
<petejones> why?
<TheRealRob> removed that and restarted d_garbage, still the smae
<TheRealRob> *same
<poisonby> No idea, I didn't pay much attention to the discussions. Though use whatever you prefer.
<d_garbage> dunno it seems to pair ok, then gets upset, tries to pair again and fails
<TheRealRob> I tried to pair again, but it was already paired, so I tried to connect, but bluez didnt like that
<poisonby> I've used pacaur and it's okay, it's just that I don't use that many packages from the AUR, so I often just use makepkg to build and rebuild
<d_garbage> grazzolini, i'm not so sure actually. I was wondering that for a while but i think they're just a bit silly sometimes
<TheRealRob> and then I got the device or resource busy in the log, so its fine for like  a second and then decides to disconnect
<TheRealRob> what can I do about this?
<petejones> poisonby: between needing mpv-git and a few aur packages, its nice to have one command to update everything
<TheRealRob> probably has to w/ the "Failed to obtain handles for "Service Changed" characteristic" line I get when starting the bluetooth daemon
<TheRealRob> but I cant seem to google up anything on how to get rid of that
<poisonby> petejones: Yeah I'm sure it's prefectly fine. According to that AUR helper comparison table, it seems to be one of the best anyway
<hackour> Boohbah, 
<thurstylark> Pacaur: not as insane as yaourt!
<d_garbage> it's up to people to decide what they use, that's fine
<petejones> Pacaur is amazing compared to yaourt. Even without the bad design and security issues, waiting for it to ask to view pkgbuild for next package was a nightmare
<d_garbage> !shrug
<phrik> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
<d_garbage> decide for yourself and also deal with any crap that results yourself too };]
<thurstylark> All in jest, really. I'm not looking to start a war
<thurstylark> !best
<phrik> Use whatever suits _you_ best.
<poisonby> !war AUR helper
<phrik> are we talking about AUR helper again?
<poisonby> Forgot the s
<poisonby> meh
<MacGyver> thurstylark: A waur?
<citazen> :: Starting AUR upgrade...nioce
<thurstylark> MacGyver: fuck. off.
* poisonby squints at MacGyver
<thurstylark> (/s)
<grazzolini> !war waur
<phrik> are we talking about waur again?
<petejones> lol never change #archlinux
<d_garbage> too late
<nicoulaj> Is it possible to delete a package from the AUR ? I uploaded a package, but I realize it was already in community (ghp-import)
<AzumaHazuki> waur...waur never commits changes
<petejones> enough time spent here will make anyone go "just juse the fucking manual tools I don't wanna hear about your convenient shit fuck you"
<utack> is there a way to allow function keys to adjust volume past 100%? (pulseaudio)
<utack> tried to find something, but nothing good came up
<petejones> hahaha
<d_garbage> nicoulaj, did you check the wiki entry?
<poisonby> nicoulaj: I mean, first google result answers your question
<d_garbage> nicoulaj, page 'aur'
<petejones> utack: for a video player?
<Infamous> utack, yes
<negen> does HDCP of any kind work in arch linux if not then are all the backend requirements now being fulfilled by widevine? 
<utack> petejones system wide, to artifically push it past 100%, as possible in the GUI controls
<utack> Infamous any idea where to set such option?
<grazzolini> utack: pactl
<petejones> utack don't think so. however in mpv for example theres the softvol option which does something similar
<Infamous> utack, amixer
<d_garbage> ?
<Infamous> maybe
<petejones> utack check daemon.conf settings? idk
<d_garbage> that would be a 'nope' i think
<tuelz> if `iw link` isn't showing my wifi device, what can I do to get it up and running?
<tuelz> corrction `ifconfig` isn't showing my device
<d_garbage> isn't it 'ip' you use?
<tuelz> `iw list` shows nothing as well, though
<tuelz> ip link just shows lo and usb (currently tethering my phone)
<d_garbage> oh, ok
<utack> grazzolini that allows manually setting to 150% i found out, but FN keys still go back to 100% max 
<d_garbage> if the device detected? I guess that would be dmesg/journal
<negen> lsusb or lspci might give some insight to what drivers you may need to install for your wireless controller tuelz 
<tuelz> the weirdest thing is that wireless works fine when I've got my usbc -> hdmi adapter connected xD
<d_garbage> oh lol, one of *those* problems. Good luck :P
<nicoulaj> poisonby: what's the point of your answer ?
<d_garbage> nicoulaj, just general advice, i think
<grazzolini> utack: them bind them to pactl
<tuelz> weird, lspci isn't showing anything about wifi that I can find either
<tuelz> rebooting I guess
<d_garbage> nicoulaj, i thought it sounded a bit snotty myself but it's easy to be misunderstood on the internet so it's best to assume good faith in the first instance
<utack> grazzolini just found out "+10%" works as well...will bind that to the FN keys. thanks
<nicoulaj> d_garbage: I don't think my question is *that* stupid, the AUR page only vaguely points to aur-requests archive...
<poisonby> nicoulaj: My point is that I think it's good practice to attempt to answer your own question before relying on others. As it turns out, it was quick and easy to find out. Google is a handy thing you know, no offense meant. =)
<d_garbage> nicoulaj, i wouldn't worry about it
<thurstylark> nicoulaj: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Other_requests
<phrik> Title: Arch User Repository - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<d_garbage> nicoulaj, isn't deletion in the faq?
<d_garbage> pretty sure it used to be
<d_garbage> nicoulaj, no it's in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Aur#Other_requests
<phrik> Title: Arch User Repository - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<nicoulaj> yeah, thanks
<d_garbage> you're welcome
<tuelz> hmm, reboot still shows nothing looking thru journalctl but not sure what I should be looking for other than red crap xD
<d_garbage> "Note: aur-mirror is no longer available" <- i bet someone mirrored it :P
<thurstylark> d_garbage: nothing dies on the internet
<tuelz> whats dead can never die
<tuelz> like apprently my wifi chip xD
<poisonby> Considering switching to btrfs
<wyre> I need a network analysis tool which can generate a report of a long period, what do you recommend me? 
<negen> poisonby, f2fs > brtfs  
<negen> btrfs even 
<d_garbage> thurstylark, it just adds an extra dimension to the data doesn't it? I use the 'date' filter on google all the time. I wish it was more common practice to date pages clearly
<d_garbage> thurstylark, should be built-in to the internet really
<thurstylark> d_garbage: I hear you. Many times I look for info, and it's all dated too old to be relevant except for that one article/post/whatever that seems relevant from the preview and doesn't have a date
<d_garbage> yup
<d_garbage> thurstylark, sometimes on forums i mistake the date of joining of the poster for the posted date and double-take
* thurstylark knows that feel
<d_garbage> also just horrible page design, everywhere. All day every day
<thurstylark> don't get me started on date format either
<d_garbage> you have to fight your way through to what would logically be the most salient thing buried underneath the weight of 'snazzy' design' and advertising
<Jester2> Hello, I'm using pacaur -Syu to update the mainline linux kernel, and for some reason, I'm starting to get a bunch of patch messages that look like this:  "The next patch would create the file <filename>, which already exists!  Assume -R? [n]"  Can anyone explain to me what's happening here?
<citazen> ctrl+f
<spyhawk> Jester2: which version?
<citazen> !npm
<phrik> https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2933
<d_garbage> Jester2, helpers not really supported here
<Jester2> spyhawk: linux-mainline-4.10rc8-1
<spyhawk> Jester2: pacaur version?
<Jester2> d_garbage, oh, okay.
<d_garbage> Jester2, weeeeel, unless the author happens to start talking to you ;)
<Jester2> spyhawk, v5.0.1
<Jester2> er sorry
<Jester2> that's pacman.
<Jester2> pacur 4.7.2
<citazen> really 4.10 damnnnn 
<d_garbage> so mainline
<spyhawk> Jester2: don't bother reporting issue with obsolete version. Update to latest pacaur.
<citazen> pacaur -Syu
<d_garbage> citazen, leave them to it ;)
<citazen> kk :)
<Jester2> yeah, i'll update pacaur first, then do the others to see if it will clear it up.  thank you.
<citazen> n rboot
<d_garbage> that was a wonderful moment of problem meets person who solved problem
<d_garbage> even seemed genuine :)
<spyhawk> :P
<Jester2> hah
<tuelz> okay so the ath10k modules are supposedly supposed to be loaded for my dell xps 9360
<tuelz> and they aren't...so after I load them, how can I find my wifi devices name to try and bring it up?
<d_garbage> !problem

<citazen> hmm still linux 4.9.8-1
<d_garbage> citazen, don't be too impatient for the Future it comes all too quickly };]
<citazen> hahahah
<citazen> yeh i will wait till in pacman
<citazen> bugs n whoknows
<d_garbage> i usually do, though it run the linux-ck kernel so 
<d_garbage> i*
<citazen> kk. just valilla 4me
<citazen> vanilla
<d_garbage> mostly it's behind necessarily but sometimes it's ahead 
<d_garbage> like when 4.9 got stuck for a while
<d_garbage> i hate that - cuz i normally rely on people screaming here to know if there's a problem, so behind is better };]
<citazen> i could swear tho i was at 4.9.8-3 mani gotta quit smokint that stuff :)
<d_garbage> heh
<thurstylark> d_garbage: noise-related bug prioritizing. I like it.
<d_garbage> maybe just a bit less }:]
<citazen> ha
<d_garbage> thurstylark, i like to help here i never said i didn't also profit from it in other ways :)
<thurstylark> d_garbage: you have the finger on the pulse of archlinux. Mainly using it as a canary for your own updates, but so be it!
<d_garbage> damn my squigdit is farbled because of the latest update! ... delays updating a bit, heh heh heh };]
<d_garbage> recent mpv thing was classic example
<thurstylark> damn if I'm gonna let my squigdit get farbled!
<d_garbage> i could easily have rebuilt it myself but it was fixed in a few hours so :)
<thurstylark> d_garbage: must have missed the mpv thing. What happened?
<d_garbage> needed rebuild against ffmpeg
<d_garbage> iirc
<d_garbage> was like an hour or so before fixed
* thurstylark didn't do any updates this weekend, so didn't get affected either
<d_garbage> i update most every day
<d_garbage> come home from work, check updates :P
<thurstylark> I update weekdays mostly. Run arch on my work machine, so I update before leaving
<d_garbage> usually takes about 10 seconds to decide if it's breakage possible stuff and update
<d_garbage> :)
<thurstylark> yup. always checkupdates before updating :P
<d_garbage> yyus
<d_garbage> ver' handy
<beest> i never noticed because i run my own mpv and ffmpeg builds as i enjoy blaming myself when shit breaks
<thurstylark> I've debated putting a `checkupdates | wc -l` in my bar...
<d_garbage> \o/
<thurstylark> haven't yet because lazy

<Jester2> spyhawk: just to let ou know, i did an update pacaur and that eliminataed the messages I was having.  I was just having a chicken and egg situation where I was updating the kernel before updating pacaur.  thanks again.

<spyhawk> Jester2: ok, np.
<Irishluck83> is it possible to turn on the num pad at bootup. If so where?
<OhYash> installed arch for tripleboot(in addition to ubuntu n win7), installed grub. grub wont show Ubuntu
<someotherguy> these days i set up my arch linux again on a new SSD and finally managed to get into gnome. now the problem is that I don't have the network set up right at the start. after each boot  I have to "dhcpcd enp0s25" to set up the internet connection. i guess this is related to some daemon but I cannot figure out what I did wrong in the initial setup to screw this up
<Toropisco> OhYash: install os-prober and try again.
<Irishluck83> make sure you redo your grub
<Namarrgon> someotherguy: if you want the dhcpcd service to start at boot then you should enable it
<Toropisco> someotherguy: otherwise use NetworkManager, it integrates with gnome.
<OhYash> Toropisco : done, thats why it shows win7
<Irishluck83> nevermind on my issue
<negen> someotherguy, I find the easiest way to control networks is using intel's connman tool along with a gui called cmst things work out really simple 
<someotherguy> Namarrgon: I actually think I did enable it, can I check if its enabled without doing the systemctl enable command?
<Namarrgon> systemctl status <unit>
<Toropisco> OhYash: did you enable NetworkManager.service?
<negen> but to get dhcp running it should be something like sysmtemctl start/enable dhcp@INTERFACENAME.service 
<OhYash> when I grub from ubuntu, all 3 show up but arch doesnt boot
<someotherguy> well it says Loaded: loaded.... and then Active: inactive (dead)
<Namarrgon> but is it enabled?
<someotherguy>    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/dhcpcd.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
<OhYash> Toropisco : Not even installed, why would I need NetworkManager.service
<poisonby> If I add a build dependency as a normal dependency, and I fix that, do I have to increase pkgrel?
<Toropisco> OhYash: Mixed up conversations...
<poisonby> accidentally ad*
<poisonby> add* >.>
<someotherguy> Toropisco: No I don't have NetworkManager.service installed
<andreyv> poisonby: Increase pkgrel when new version would change something for the user
<d_garbage> what's your threshold?
<d_garbage> erm
<poisonby> andreyv: So it doesn't take into account fixes to the PKGBUILD itself, only the package?
<Toropisco> OhYash: When you boot from Ubuntu, do you notice something strange in grub.cfg.
<d_garbage> the dangers or reading scroll back ... 
<andreyv> poisonby: No, pkgrel means changes in PKGBUILD/other files
<Namarrgon> someotherguy: journalctl -b -u dhcpcd.service
<OhYash> Toropisco : like?
<Toropisco> someotherguy: Try with NetworkManager. Many say it is the spawn of hell, but it works quite well with gnome.
<shortCircuit__> is there a way that I can install the os directly from iso into the external hdd (in mac) .. because mac now has this C grade ports .. and I only have one convertor .. so I . can't boot my usb drive and install in the external hdd at the same time.. plz plz plz help 
<someotherguy> Namarrgon: No entries
<poisonby> andreyv: I see, thanks
<andreyv> poisonby: When you fix a typo in the PKGBUILD comment, you don't need to change pkgrel, because for users nothing changes
<Namarrgon> someotherguy: is that the unit you enabled?
<d_garbage> lol
<andreyv> poisonby: If you change dependencies, then users see it, so you probably need to increase pkgrel
<Toropisco> OhYash: something different from the configuration lines in Arch's grub.cfg
<OhYash> Toropisco : lemmi check
<poisonby> andreyv: Understood, thanks!
<someotherguy> Namarrgon: I thought I did at least... I enabled it now again but the status still doesnt seem right, no?
<Namarrgon> someotherguy: post the 'systemctl' output
<shortCircuit__> can I use virtual box and boot the os and install it in the external hdd ?
<someotherguy> ‚óè dhcpcd.service - dhcpcd on all interfaces    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/dhcpcd.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)    Active: inactive (dead)
<poisonby> someotherguy: Note that you enable it with: systemctl enable --now dhcpcd@INTERFACE.service
<poisonby> It probably turns inactive if you don't specify the interface
<OhYash> Toropisco : Yep, arch's grub.cfg is way shorter than ubuntu's
<someotherguy> poisonby: so in my case dhcpcd@enp0s25.... ?
<poisonby> someotherguy: If that's the network interface, yes
<someotherguy> hmm it failed, sec
<someotherguy> Feb 13 19:44:26 archnix systemd[1]: Starting dhcpcd on enp0s25... Feb 13 19:44:26 archnix systemd[1]: dhcpcd@enp0s25.service: Control process exited, code=exited status=1 Feb 13 19:44:26 archnix systemd[1]: Failed to start dhcpcd on enp0s25.

<poisonby> someotherguy: Maybe you can get some more information from the journal
<Toropisco> OhYash: copy the arch menuentry lines into custom.cfg in ubuntu and you would be set. Afterwards you want try to regenerate arch's grub.cfg
<Toropisco> And see if it sees the ubuntu partition.
<someotherguy> poisonby: yea it's saying that dhcpcd is already running on pid 1185
<Toropisco> Mind that if you are using a GPT disk, you can only have one grub boot partition....
<poisonby> someotherguy: Kill it? :P
* Jupelius_ is now known as Jupelius
<poisonby> someotherguy: If you enabled some systemd service, ls /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ | egrep dhcpcd
<poisonby> And stop the service
<poisonby> disable
<someotherguy> poisonby: yea just did :D killed it, enabled the service, now status says "failed to start dhcpcd on enp0s25"
<poisonby> someotherguy: Check journal again
<poisonby> someotherguy: Is the interface UP?
<someotherguy> poisonby: journal did not update
<someotherguy> also the other command you mentioned gives back: dhcpcd.service and dhcpcd@enp0s25.service so ill just disable the first one eh?
<poisonby> Yeah
<poisonby> someotherguy: is the interface up in ip link?
<someotherguy> yes
<someotherguy> disabled the other one, enabled the "proper" one, still says failed on status...
<poisonby> someotherguy: Double check you don't have any typos in the command
<someotherguy> poisonby: which command?
<blueblur112198> how would one install both nvidia-libgl and mesa-libgl on an nvidia optimus machine
<poisonby> someotherguy: Also, maybe I should've lead with this, you *are* using ethernet right? :P
<someotherguy> yep yep :)
<poisonby> Nice
<blueblur112198> primusrun <command> works unless a glx context needs to be created
<poisonby> someotherguy: $ sudo systemctl enable --now dhcpcd@enp0s25.service
<someotherguy> it's also the same machine so i'm actually using that ethernet connection right now
<poisonby> Wait
<poisonby> How?
<poisonby> VM?
<someotherguy> well like i said, when I do "dhcpcd enp0s25" after booting up, THEN the connection works
<someotherguy> the problem was that i have to type this every time i boot up
<poisonby> pgrep dhcpcd
<someotherguy> what does that do?
<poisonby> But since you're still connected, I assume there's some conflict. Try $ sudo systemctl enavbe dhcpcd@enp0s25.service instead and reboot
<poisonby> without --now
<poisonby> someotherguy: It checks if there's a process matching dhcpcd running
<someotherguy> it returned nothing
<someotherguy> but ill do the other command and reboot then
<poisonby> Good luck!
<poisonby> someotherguy: same command but disable if you need to disable it and reboot later for some reason
<blueblur112198> http://ix.io/1Tie
<blueblur112198> there's what happens when I try to run "primusrun glxgears"
<blueblur112198> I'm fairly sure it's because I have mesa-libgl installed and not nvidia-libgl
<blueblur112198> but I need mesa-libgl for my intel graphics device
* Eyess is now known as eyes

<Namarrgon> pacman -Qs nvidia
<Namarrgon> i don't think primus works with the blob unless you use bumblebee
<Namarrgon> which provides the symlinks otherwise found in nvidia-libgl
<blueblur112198> Namarrgon: I am using bumblebee
<blueblur112198> maybe I should reinstall it

<blueblur112198> Namarrgon: let me do a quick pacman -Syu and install non-lts nvidia drivers
<jonascj> Good evening. 'pacman -Syu' failed because haskell-x11 is now 1.8-1 but my aur xmonad-git and xmonad-contrib-git requires haskell-x11 < 1.8. How should I resolve this best, I'd like to keep using xmonad-git? Should I force the upgrade which will upgrade haskell-x11 to 1.8-1, and then rebuilg my aur packages (which I can not do now because the aur packages now require haskell-x11>1.8)?
<citazen> yes rebuild, thus system is up to date
<teraflops> jonascj: do I have a dejavu?
* d_garbage made coffee, the World is safe again, for the time being }:]
<citazen> hahhaha
<citazen> pacman -Syu coffee
<d_garbage> if only
<jonascj> teraflops: I have likely had a similar problem in the recent past, so probably yes. Apparently it takes a few more cases to become self sufficient in resolving these issue (without breaking things too badly which I would do on my own).
<d_garbage> like that robot in that film
<citazen> yeah that film...
<teraflops> jonascj: may I ask what's wrong with using xmonad and xmonad-contrib from repos?
<d_garbage> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robby_the_Robot
<phrik> Title: Robby the Robot - Wikipedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
<citazen> im thinking more of a strtreck replicator
<jonascj> teraflops: #xmonad says it makes most sense to use the latest git version of xmonad since they do infrequent releases.
<citazen> im pretty sure nanos would play a role in that one
<d_garbage> citazen, 'Monsters from the ID!" };]
<jonascj> teraflops: however, the issues which caused me to use the git version are resolved in 0.13-1, so maybe I should just revert to that.
<d_garbage> also that wikipedia article is crap
<teraflops> jonascj: I never felt the need of doing xmonad from git, for the same reasons you are saying, and xmonad is well mantained (now) in arch repos 
<jonascj> in that case I would just remove xmonad-git and xmonad-contrib-git, then upgrade and install the non-aur version of xmonad?
<teraflops> jonascj: that's what I'm doing for 3 years :)
<teraflops> pacman -Syu
<d_garbage> holy shit that's my first example of, "who said this exactly?!" on a wiki, lol
<teraflops> jonascj: not saying: go use xmonad from repos, just describing what I do 
<d_garbage> a garbled load of schlock instead of the real metaphors :P lol
<jonascj> teraflops: the 0.12 version (which were in the arch repos until very recently, 3 days ago?) suffered frome some caching issues which were only fixed by using the -git versions.
<jonascj> teraflops: atm 0.13-1 from the repos will do it for me, so I might as well leave the -git versions for now, returning to them if need be (other bugs)
<teraflops> sure, but I don't know what issues are you talking about
* chee is now known as petal
* petal is now known as chee
* chee is now known as snes
<jonascj> teraflops: struct caching where status bars would be covered on first loading untill you reset the layouts, reloaded xmonad or similar.
* snes is now known as chee
<teraflops> jonascj: which status bar?
<jonascj> https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/xmonad/2016-March/015057.html
<phrik> Title: [xmonad] Can avoidStruts stop working? (at mail.haskell.org)
<teraflops> jonascj: which one?
<jonascj> teraflops: I think all bars under certain circumstances. In my case xmobar
<teraflops> ah, I use dzen2 never had that issue
<jonascj> I see, maybe all bars are not equal with respect to that bug / issue :)
<jonascj> do you agree that I should just remove xmonad-git and xmonad-contrib-git, do the system-upgrade, then install the repo versions?
<teraflops> I think so
<jonascj> as a way to transition from the git versions to the repo versions
<teraflops> wait my I think so was about the bars^
<teraflops> jonascj: do what you want, I'm just describing what I do, also I don't so xmobar
<teraflops> so/do

<delmadord> Hello, makepkg extracts package but it has wrong permissions inside. How to make chmod on extracted contents?
<jonascj> trulyyourswo: you can use nslookup or similar to find the ip corresponding to xxx.com, then you can look it up in a geolocation database like https://www.iplocation.net/
<d_garbage> delmadord, start at the beginning
<teraflops> trulyyourswo: it has dns record like A or AAAA?
<jonascj> alhtough ip geolocation is at best accurate to country or city, not more than that.
<d_garbage> delmadord, as in what do you want to do, what did you try and what was the result?
<trulyyourswo> dns record A or AAAA ? what's AAAA

<d_garbage> good idea

<fpqc> heya
<fpqc> anyone know if theres a way to make it so

<redjollyroger> when i type pacman -S xorg is that a group package installing everything?
<poisonby> redjollyroger: Yes, don't do that
<fpqc> redjollyroger, yeah probably don't
<redjollyroger> shit
<fpqc> anyone know how to do that thing
<redjollyroger> already done was watching a video on and dude did that and after i did it i though hmmm i dont see anything in the docmentation that says that i need to do that.
<poisonby> redjollyroger: Don't watch videos, use the official wiki
<poisonby> redjollyroger: pacman -S xorg drives in a whole bunch of shit that you don't need, like various graphic card drivers.
<redjollyroger> poisonby: i am doing both reading the wiki first then watching videos to get a better understanding as they explain it. That why i realized the i never read anything about just downloading the xorg group
<thurstylark> Still, videos are quickly outdated and very rarely of good quality.
<poisonby> redjollyroger: Don't watch videos; videos tend to get outdated very quickly, and they're not reviewed in the same manner as the wiki
<redjollyroger> poisonby: will do 
<redjollyroger> ill just stick to the wiki and this channel
<poisonby> If a package requires pkg-config (which exists in base-devel), should I add that as a dependency?
<poisonby> In the PKGBUILD
<thurstylark> poisonby: base-devel is implicit to the ability to build packages, so I'd say no.
<SexHendrix> poisonby: i think everything in base and base-devel are implied
<poisonby> Yeah, that's what I thought as well. Thanks!
<esph> poisonby: explicitly in the wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Aur#Prerequisites
<phrik> Title: Arch User Repository - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<thurstylark> poisonby: rule of thumb with depends is that you shouldn't include them explicitly if they're implicit to something else. If pkg-config was a depends and not just a build-depends, then I'd include it.
<poisonby> thurstylark: Thanks
<thurstylark> np

<poisonby> Just to be sure, I guess adding new dependencies to the package means you have to increment pkgrel right?
<thurstylark> yeah. any change to just the PKGBUILD but not the source should be a pkgrel bump.
<poisonby> Alright, thanks again! :P
<thurstylark> also, pkgrel should be reset to 1 on a source version bump
<redjollyroger> besides xorg-server and xorg-server-utils do i require any other xorg packages before installin a desktop enviroment. it seems on the wiki that those are the only to needed, but almost all other documentation i have read usually has more xorg packages
<poisonby> redjollyroger: xorg-xinit
<redjollyroger> poisonby: that package is needed to auto start the xserver correct?
<poisonby> redjollyroger: Yes, specifically, it's the package that manages ~/.xinitrc
<demonicmaniac3> that's kinda of badly worded
<demonicmaniac3> nothing manages files in ~ :)
<redjollyroger> hehe
<demonicmaniac3> it's the program that parses ~/.xinitrc would probably be better
<thurstylark> parses/runs ya know, since it's a script :P
<angrynapkin> I am having a very strange behavior. When I am connected to wifi, no programs want to start. When running from a terminal, I get the message "No Protocal Specified". If I disconnect from wifi, the apps work. Forexample, disconnect from wifi, launch firefox, reconnect wifi, is what I need to do to get firefox open. Other wise I just get "No Protocal Specified". Added to this, while WIFI is connected, I am unable to select any of t

<angrynapkin> How can I check my host name?
<poisonby> angrynapkin: hostname
<tigrmesh> i had weird problems with connman.  even after i uninstalled it

<kstenger> Hi! I'm trying to find the Xorg.0.log file in my arch system, but I am unable to find it anywhere. Does it have a different name in arch? I've also googled about this and found no information. it's not here ~/.local/share/xorg/ nor here /var/log/
<mpan> kstenger: /var/log
<Namarrgon> it can also be in the journal
<Namarrgon> the systemd journal
<kstenger> mpan: not there read my message :-)
<mpan> kstenger: wait, ignore. Mistook /var/log for /run/log :P
<kstenger> in the journal, hmm
<Dan39> also in like ~/.local or ~/.share iirc
<kstenger> Namarrgon: how could I find it exactly please?
<grazzolini> kstenger: journalctl
<Dan39> ~/.local/share/xorg 
<Dan39> sometimes :p
<kstenger> ok, thanks for the info guys/gals :-)
<Dan39> not sure how they showed up there on me once haha
* eschwartz is now known as ztrawhcse
<Dan39> in 2015 hahaha
* eschwartz1 is now known as eschwartz
<mpan> kstenger: `journalctl _COMM=Xorg`, if I recall correctly, but ask Namarrgon for details.
<grazzolini> Dan39: it is .local/share/xorg first, then /var/log/Xorg.0.log
<sudokode> das narwhal!
<grazzolini> Dan39: only if auto detection fails it goes to /var/log
<Namarrgon> kstenger: how do you start X?
<kstenger> Namarrgon: not sure what you ask, I use gdm
<sudokode> X --gonna-give-it-to-ya
<sudokode> oh X uses single dashes, doesn't it?
<kstenger> journalctl _COMM=Xorg says no entries
<Namarrgon> journalctl -b -u gdm.service
<grazzolini> kstenger: yep, gdm logs to the journal only
<Namarrgon> gdm might be running with the wayland backend though
<Namarrgon> so it's possible that you won't find xorg logs
<grazzolini> by default it does, doesn't it?
<Namarrgon> yup
<kstenger> Namarrgon: yes, wayland ... 3 lines of log :-(
<Namarrgon> what is the problem anyway?
<daurnimator> grazzolini: just saw your reply.
<daurnimator> grazzolini: does libtls even exist properly yet?
<grazzolini> daurnimator: on OpenBSD it does :P

<phrik> Title: linux.conf.au 2017 | Presentation: libtls: Rethinking the TLS/SSL API (at linux.conf.au)
<kstenger> Namarrgon: Yes actually the problem is another to debug: I'm trying to make my UC-LOGIC_Tablet_WP8060U work, I have been trying every single configuration I found in the last 2 days, it gets listed among /dev/input/* but never with 'xinput list'
<Namarrgon> notice the x in xinput?
<kstenger> It worked a couple of years ago, it was a long time since I didn't use it and now I cannot get it configured properly
<kstenger> Namarrgon: yes
<kstenger> Namarrgon: I mean the xinput command
<Namarrgon> if you're using wayland then don't expect the X* stuff to work

<poeticrpm> is it possible to have iptables force block everything not going through a VPN while routing one application (chrome) outside the vpn tunnel?
<grazzolini> poeticrpm: why would you want that?
<grazzolini> (it is possible)
<poeticrpm> grazzolini, because netflix blows
<wasutton3> alyptik, "lp foobar.pdf" prints 10 copies
<alyptik> wow
<grazzolini> poeticrpm: is this about geo restriction or it is something else?
<alyptik> kinda weird hm
<Foxboron> Ugh, throwing xorg into systemd user units is still broken...
* Foxboron writes of 2 days on the problems
<poeticrpm> grazzolini, i travel a lot and use netflix on hotel wifi and all that- so I have to down all the vpn crap which is stupid on unsecured wifi
<poeticrpm> no, im in the US and wanting to use US netflix
<grazzolini> poeticrpm: just connect to a VPN server in US?
<grazzolini> poeticrpm: or they are blocking it too?
<poeticrpm> grazzolini, doesnt work
<poeticrpm> yup- blocking
<grazzolini> poeticrpm: stupid netflix.
<poeticrpm> tried all the US servers of my vpn
<poeticrpm> well, most
<poeticrpm> grazzolini, yeah, really ticks me off
<wasutton3> alyptik, "lp -n 1 foobar.pdf" also results in multiple copies
<alyptik> wasutton3‚Ä∫ lpoptions
<alyptik> is it copies=10?
<poeticrpm> grazzolini, do I need to use route or is it possible to just use iptables somehow?
<poeticrpm> Ive figured out to use -m owner and launch chrome as a different user, but I dont know how to use iptables to force chrome to not use the vpn tunnel
<alyptik> wasutton3‚Ä∫ if so `lpoptions -o copies=1`
<grazzolini> poeticrpm: you have some options, I guess using network namespaces is one. but all of them are complex
<alyptik> wasutton3‚Ä∫ if not then damn, we have a mystery on our hands
<wasutton3> yup
<wasutton3> copies=1
<wasutton3> is mystery
<alyptik> da fuq
<alyptik> wasutton3: printer may be haunted
<poeticrpm> grazzolini, well, at least its possible :|
<grazzolini> poeticrpm: as I said, it  is
<grazzolini> also  it is a pita to do it
<daurnimator> poeticrpm: can you create/get a list of netflix ips?
<daurnimator> poeticrpm: routing based on destination ip is much easier
<poeticrpm> grazzolini, you'd think my use case would be common for netflix.. and hence theyd have some other way (like using billing to determine location if the person wants to)
<poeticrpm> daurnimator, so basically just use the tunnel to find netflix ips then input that into the browser?
<poeticrpm> oh nevermind- that was a really dumb statement
<wasutton3> alyptik, works just fine with the windows machines in the house. and it USED to work with linux too. 
<daurnimator> poeticrpm: no... look up a list of netflix ips online. create an routing table entry to prefer that over your vpn route
<alyptik> wasutton3: I honestly have no idea what could cause this
<alyptik> wasutton3: maybe a faulty driver is my only guess
<grazzolini> daurnimator: I think it's almost next to impossible to do that
<wasutton3> on two seperate computers?
<alyptik> they use diff drivers? 
<wasutton3> nope
<poeticrpm> daurnimator, not sure.. i was kind of thinking what grazzolini did about the difficulty but ill approach that angle too
<alyptik> wasutton3: I mean the driver package may possibly be broke, but I am talking out of my ass
<alyptik> no idea really
<wasutton3> i know, im kinda lost as to what the hell is happening too. 
<alyptik> hm
<alyptik> wasutton3: ipp or lpr 
<wasutton3> lpr
<alyptik> wasutton3: try ipp maybe
<wasutton3> well, technically it comes out lpd
<daurnimator> grazzolini: why?/which bit?
<alyptik> wasutton3: usually ipp://ip:631/ipp/print or aomething
<alyptik> something *

<tlvb> Hello, I have trouble getting nouveau to work with my geforce fx 5500 (no longer supported by nvidia) when trying to load the kernel module I get the same error as some do for nvidia (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA/Troubleshooting (#23)) the suggested fix (to disable pcie power management does not work (which is hardly surprising since it's an agp card)) does not work. Any advice?
<phrik> Title: NVIDIA/Troubleshooting - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<tlvb> The full url is (but I thought it was too long to embed in the message): https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA/Troubleshooting#Modprobe_Error:_.22Could_not_insert_.27nvidia.27:_No_such_device.22_on_linux_.3E.3D4.8
<phrik> Title: NVIDIA/Troubleshooting - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<beest> tlvb: which error is the same?
<beest> you get a "no such device" with the nouveau module?
<tlvb> yeah, and if I try to manually modprobe it, I get the same longer message
<beest> you're a little vague, no one's gonna do much for you without logs
<beest> comparing it to this isn't helpful when you apparently have neither the blob nor bumblebee
<tlvb> gah, I hate myself sometimes, there were differences in the error message, that I did not initially see :<
<tlvb> anyway, logs: https://bpaste.net/show/8986c757c0db
<phrik> Title: show at bpaste (at bpaste.net)
<tlvb> hm, I think there was some acpi error flashing during boot, given that buttons.ko is related, maybe I should look for trouble in the acpi domain
<beest> tlvb: did you try to install the proprietary drivers at some point? do you have the module blacklisted?
<tlvb> I'm on a fresh install, according to the wiki even the legacy proprietary modules are too new for my card, so I'm running on nouveau before anything else
<tlvb> s/before.*$/without having installed anything else before/
<beest> button.ko.gz is for power button events, that shouldn't be related
<beest> tlvb: did you just recently install and then do a -Syu?
<tlvb> I am doing the fresh install as we speak, this is me trying to get X up and running, which hit a snag
<beest> if lspci says it's using nouveau, it's using nouveau
<beest> but if you told it to load it again it wouldn't complain like that
<beest> so yeah, i'm stumped, also been away from nvidia for a couple of years
<tlvb> is it actively using, or makes nouveau autoload on boot? because lsmod | grep noveau returns nothing
<beest> because it looks like what would happen if you updated the kernel and didn't reboot
<beest> lspci would show that you're using nouveau, but trying to load it would fail because the module it's looking for isn't there anymore
<beest> you shouldn't have to modprobe nouveau in the first place
<beest> but this is probably an xy problem because you didn't mention why you're trying to modprobe nouveau to begin with

<earnestly> eschwartz: llpp isn't maintainable, upstream sucks
<earnestly> fish5555: Fix your guid
<fish5555> earnestly: can i access the guid through grub
<thrice> llpp won my award for most hated project since starting with linux in 2004
<fish5555> it has limited commands
<earnestly> fish5555: You can at least try to boot the machine from the recovery shell, which has tab completion and ls and stuff
<eschwartz> earnestly: But you have your own PKGBUILDs for it (at least, llpp-git) so I figured you might want to at least try and make the best of it.
<eschwartz> Or have you switched to something else?
<tlvb> beest, I'm modprobing nouveau since I installed it in order to see if X would start without a reboot. It didnt. So I rebooted, but the problem persists, so then I check to see if the nouveau module is loaded, and it isn't so I try to load it, and here we are. ~more or less
<earnestly> eschwartz: It doesn't build though, malc uses arbitrary commits from mupdf, mupdf breaks API every second change.  So the only hope is to make sure it builds when mupdf releases, and then it'll be broken again for awhile
<beest> tlvb: did you actually install the xorg driver?
<earnestly> eschwartz: Upstream really does not care at all
<beest> tlvb: nouveau doesn't get installed, it's a kernel module

<earnestly> fish5555: blkid can be used in such an environment to find it
<earnestly> I'd also use UUIDs, I've just had more success with them

<jack_boss> I just noticed that the tip in regards to the snippet should suggest Type=idle if you run Arch as guest with Virtualbox
<jack_boss> i couldn't figure out why VBOXClient-all wasn't working so i went over all Wikis again
<jack_boss> now i just need to figure out if its bspwm default behaviour that if i hover a new created terminal that it won't let me type in it or if i do have to use a key-combo
<fish5555> im worried that since i installed arch before correctly and then deleted it that there is another grub file on my computer somewhere that is conflicting
<markasoftware> jack_boss: you have to use a key combo out of the box
<markasoftware> or you can use `bspc` to enable focus following pointer
<markasoftware> The default key combinations are super + hjkl to move around focus
<fish5555> earnestly: i used blkid and i have UUIDs
<markasoftware> like vim
<jack_boss> markasoftware: ty i did find the snippet for bspwmrc just now
<jack_boss> couldn't take it.. but copy paste wasn't working between host and guest and that was bugging me even more so i had to fix that first
<jack_boss> btw, does copy&paste between host and client only work in X right?
<markasoftware> it's a one-liner to enable focus following pointer, you shouldn't have to copy paste itt

<thrice> you need to -Syu then
<makmm> thrice: i did
<thrice> no you didn't
<thrice> or, your mirror sucks
<thrice> should be looking for 3.22.3-1, which was updated today
<makmm> thrice: oh... its looking for 3.22.2-1
<mpan> makmm: which mirror are you using?
<makmm> mpan: 6 different mirrors..let me put it on a pastebin
<thrice> or just wait a little bit and try again
<mpan> makmm: well‚Ä¶ just tell the one which gives you 404.
<makmm> mpan: all of them
<mpan> Ok, then give any of them.
<mpan> Something smelly happening here, if all 6 mirrors have their packages lists updated, but not packages themselves.
<makmm> how do i select an specific version?
<thrice> or his primary mirror has the stale db file, and all of the other mirrors actually have the new package
<mpan> makmm: you don‚Äôt.
<mpan> thrice: good point.
<wasutton3> alyptik, the best part of this feeling is that the windows firmware update tool didn't work on my wife's windows laptop
<mpan> makmm: are you using reflector?
<makmm> mpan: i guess im going to do it tomorrow, need to sleep.
<makmm> mpan: ?
<mpan> makmm: then use it.

<jack_boss> do i need to configure alsa aswell for auido in firefox with arch guest?
<jack_boss> eh, why do i need to install alsa-utils if alsa is built in, how to unmute otherwise

<luuuciano> there is any way to isolate hdd badblocks?
<mpan> luuuciano: define ‚Äúisolate‚Äù.
<mpan> Also make sure you‚Äôre talking explicitly about HDDs only and not all mass media.
<luuuciano> mpan, well... maybe it is automatic? when a bad block is found it is never used again? I do not know how it works...
<mpan> luuuciano: where? On HDD (are you really asking about HDD or any mass media, I‚Äôm asking again)? It‚Äôs done by the hardware unless the drive is so damaged that it shouldn‚Äôt be used anyway.
<wasutton3> aaaaand printer screweyness fix documented and wiki'd https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CUPS/Printer-specific_problems#Multiple_Copy_Problem
<phrik> Title: CUPS/Printer-specific problems - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<mpan> luuuciano: basically if the head delivers signals that, while decoded, don‚Äôt match the checksum, it is assumed that the block may be damaged. The rest is producer-specific and no producer releases its info on that, but in general firmware performs a check to see if a sector is damaged and marks it as such if needed, internally. The only sign of such event is in SMART.
<luuuciano> mpan, yes, a HDD, it is a portable hdd that a friend gift me (just used to store movies), today I was copying to another bigger hdd and some files failed
<mpan> luuuciano: then it seems it is damaged to the extent it should not be used for ages.
<mpan> (Or it has been seriously damaged in transport)
<luuuciano> well... I just use it to see movies on TV, not a big deal
<mpan> Then deal with the fact that you‚Äôll have some damages to the files.
* swedishfish is now known as blt
<luuuciano> but was wondering if those bad sectors will be "marked" to not be used again, that is automatic? by the firmware?
<mpan> Yes, by the firmware.
<mpan> But since the bad secors are already visible to your system, as it seems from your description, it menas that the platters are damaged so much that firmware is not capable to cover up for damaged sectors.

<Antioch> I've added a new Host to my ssh config file, but when I run `ssh [hostname]` I get the error "Cannot resolve hostname [hostname]: Name or service unknown"

<gtxbb> if you use -v with ssh, it should print out more details(-vv, -vvv, -vvvv)
<blt> gtxbb: nothing directly, i just want to be able to click around and stuff :p
<blt> i figure i should probably cross check with a livecd to make sure it's not actually a hw problem...
<gtxbb> blt, maybe you loosened a connetor 
<nodocify> Antioch: that error is saying that [hostname] isn't being resolved by your dns server. Try adding the host to your /etc/hosts file.

<amstan> hey, i'm wondering if there's a way to make my network connect as soon as there's an interface. "systemctl enable dhcpd@eth0" is not quite right (it delays boot if my usb ethernet is not connected, and it doesn't work if i connect it later)
<markasoftware> what's wrong with dmenu?
<Irishluck83> yeah rofi -run
<markasoftware> amstan: you'll w ant to get some sort of network manager thing, such as NetworkManager or wicd
<amstan> markasoftware: given that i'm running wifi-menu from time to time, don't i already have a network manager running?
<Irishluck83> no
<markasoftware> i think wifi-menu is some fancy standalone thing
<Irishluck83> its a sperate app
<markasoftware> that just calls wpa_supplicant or whatever
<Antioch> I've added a new Host to my ssh config file, but when I run `ssh [hostname]` I get the error "Cannot resolve hostname [hostname]: Name or service unknown". Do I have to do something special to get ssh to use the config file (it's in ~/.ssh/config).
<amstan> but wifi-menu creates some profile for me, and i can later come and enable/start/stop that profile with systemd
<amstan> different thing?
<sheep> Wifi-menu is a wrapper around netctl
<Antioch> I don't believe I need to add the server address to the hosts file because, accoring to man, the ssh config's 
<Antioch> "Host"  entry acts as an alias for the server address, which is listed later in the config file
<occultus> if you use wifi-menu, netctl-auto@interface is the corresponding "automagic" service
<amstan> occultus: will that block my boot if there's nothing interesting to connect to?
<occultus> amstan: no. also, why did you start by asking about ethernet and then transition to wifi-menu?
<amstan> occultus: i kinda want both

<snowalpaca> hi all
<poisonby> Hello snowalpaca
<snowalpaca> hi poisonby
<snowalpaca> have fond memories of archlinux from Operating Systems...our professor insisted it was the best system to install for the class
<snowalpaca> something about it being a light operating system? just curious - but i never fully understood this- but why is archlinux so popular in the OS world?
<eschwartz> !as
<phrik> Arch Sucks‚Ñ¢
<eschwartz> FYI, the Arch Way says nothing about being lightweight. :)
<snowalpaca> lol..my impression of it was that is was antiquated
<snowalpaca> ah ok, so what about it makes it different from other linux distributions?
<eschwartz> correctness of design is more the goal. Arch strives to ship software as upstream intended it, and doesn't get between the user and the system
<eschwartz> !g archwiki the arch way
<phrik> eschwartz: The Arch Way - ArchWiki <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=The_Arch_Way&redirect=no>
<AppleDash> Why are we phasing out i686? I just installed Arch i686 earlier today :(
<eschwartz> AppleDash: Because few devs actually test in i686?
<AppleDash> It is my favourite distro for older systems because it doesn't come with any bloat but is also a binary distro so I don't have to worry about compilarion
<AppleDash> compilation*
<eschwartz> snowalpaca: Ah, apparently the correct page is now https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux
<phrik> Title: Arch Linux - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
<snowalpaca> ohhh what you just mentioned, the bloat,, i think the boat you're referencing is what my professor was referring to
<snowalpaca> i interpreted it as "lightweight" 
<snowalpaca> but it's something else?
<eschwartz> AppleDash: Visit #archlinux-ports and don't give up hope quite yet. ;)
<tigrmesh> fewer people on the dev team have i686 machines
<AppleDash> I have like 8 i686 machines
<snowalpaca> awesome, thanks for the link eschwartz
<AppleDash> I wish Arch ran on i386 because I'd run it on those 2 if I could
<eschwartz> snowalpaca: Arch Linux by default comes with support for everything compiled in, and ships headers and docs in the main package. This is "simpler"
<AppleDash> too* not 2 o.o
<eschwartz> snowalpaca: Arch Linux makes sure you know how your system works, essentially by not holding your hand, ever.
<poisonby> snowalpaca: It's not particularly light, there are better distributions for that.
<eschwartz> And bloat is not really avoided... a Debian netinstall results in a much less bloaty system
<snowalpaca> eschwartz: ah ok, that sounds familiar - so making you perform all the typically packaged installations/operations youself?
<eschwartz> Because Debian splits everything into way too many packages; it may be smaller, but it is a lot more complicated to manage
<poisonby> snowalpaca: The reason it's popoular is probably because of the quick and easy installation process (with the install scripts), the new (but stable) packages, the AUR and how it keeps itself from making too many downstream changes
<eschwartz> snowalpaca: e.g We have no GUI package manager
<eschwartz> And packaging *for* arch is far easier than Debian
<poisonby> Oh, and the ABS
<poisonby> PKGBUILDs are so easy to create
<snowalpaca> i see..so you mentioned that it ships with everything compiled and the headers and docs in the main package - what do other OS's tend to do then?
<poisonby> snowalpaca: Split the packages - libraries etc. into one, program into another.
<snowalpaca> it seems like it would make sense to compile everything and also include docs/headers?
<snowalpaca> ohh
<snowalpaca> i see
<poisonby> snowalpaca: Most distributions are binary; Gentoo is an alternative that's a source based distribution.
<eschwartz> Well, Debian usually creates ${package}-dev and ${package}-doc for most/everything
<occultus> for example, a zlib library package and a zlib headers package that are separate
<eschwartz> This becomes a lot more complicated for people seeking to build their own packages (e.g. use the AUR)
<eschwartz> You can easily duplicate that in Arch though, using NoExtract in pacman.conf though. :D
<eschwartz> Assuming you want that
<snowalpaca> ah ,might be misinterpreting this - but it sounds like it's a lot easier to create your own packages in arch because of the all unified headers and the compiled code
<eschwartz> Yes. :)
<poisonby> Compiled code?
<eschwartz> Well, more specifically, headers and the shared libraries they are related to.
<snowalpaca> interesting...thanks for helping clear up a lot of the stuff i didn't fully understand about arch eschwartz, poisonby
<snowalpaca> appreciate it :)
<poisonby> No worries
<Nuc1eoN> nodocify, thanks! Would I also need the powerline plugin for this? 
<Nuc1eoN> or is it independent
<nodocify> You would need to install the powerline fonts. github.com/powerline/fonts is what i have used in the past.
<Nuc1eoN> nodocify, yes thanks. Do I also need the powerline plugin? http://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html
<phrik> Title: Overview ‚Äî Powerline beta documentation (at powerline.readthedocs.io)

<DeaDSouL> hi, I'm using KDE, Dolphin can't mount nfs or cifs shares that are mentioned in /etc/fstab. it says "An error occurred while accessing 'Home', the system responded: mount: only root can mount 192.168.0.99:/media on /mnt/media1" ... am I missing something? or is it a known bug?
<phroa> DeaDSouL: now, I haven't used those fses, but consider having systemd mount it on boot and remount when the network drops, seeing as it's already in fstab and you're not mounting it entirely on the fly: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NFS#Mount_using_.2Fetc.2Ffstab_with_systemd
<phrik> Title: NFS - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)

<DeaDSouL> poisonby: short answer, to have a fixed mountpoint and options
<poisonby> DeaDSouL: But by having them in fstab, they *are* automounted
<DeaDSouL> poisonby: no they're not as long as 'noauto' is there
<poisonby> DeaDSouL: Well, can you mount them with mount -a as a user? Since Dolphin seems to be complaining

<zoidq> / 1
<alyptik> + 2
<poisonby> zoidq: / 1 to you too
<zoidq> haha
<zoidq> just testing out weechat, have been using irssi for years
<poisonby> The configuration is overwhelming, though overall it's better
<alyptik> much rainbow https://ptpb.pw/5WXw.png
<alyptik> i love weechat
<poisonby> alyptik: Those arrows look amazing on that font
<poisonby> What's ##? :P
<alyptik> poisonby‚Ä∫ i have no fucking idea
<alyptik> poisonby‚Ä∫ also yay 
<alyptik> i love this font too
<poisonby> Did you know you can use rofi to select URLs in st with a patch? It's pretty damn sweet
<occultus> alyptik: is that just weechat but with 80 billion plugins?
<alyptik> occultus‚Ä∫ winner winner chicken dinner
<alyptik> poisonby‚Ä∫ i did not, that's neat
<occultus> alyptik: i thought at first you had a bunch of floating terminals
<alyptik> lol
* poisonby squints, looking for any hint of porn
<amstan> markasoftware, occultus: i gave up on netctl and switched to networkmanager/nmtui
<amstan> netctl sucks for interfaces and appear and dissapear, like usb
<amstan> i would have had to add extra udev things just for that
<PatrolDoom> DeaDSouL: cause you not using it correctly
<poisonby> Wasn't there a really cool curses frontend to wpa_supplicant? Can't remember the name
<PatrolDoom> poisonby: wpa_supplicant
<PatrolDoom> !give poisonby next
<phrik> poisonby: Another satisfied customer! NEXT!
* poisonby never uses wifi
<poisonby> Oh, it's built in? Though it was CLI only
<poisonby> s/Though/Thought
* PatrolDoom has no clue & confuses poisonby further
<occultus> lol
<PatrolDoom> occultus: wut up
<PatrolDoom> lawd wat am i watching - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29olhSSHoCs
<phrik> Title: Forgotten Cartoons And Toys Of The 80's - YouTube (at www.youtube.com)
* PatrolDoom has issues
<occultus> too long didn't watch
<PatrolDoom> occultus: GO BOTS
<PatrolDoom> just put in on in the background & enjoy the randomness
<occultus> but muh pianobar
<zoidq> certainly need to turn off all these join/part messages in weechat
<zoidq> and figure out how to split windows
<PatrolDoom> 1st is easy
<PatrolDoom> 2nd idk but its possible
<zoidq> need i3-wm style tiling, that would be great
<PatrolDoom> well idk if thats possible 
<zoidq> I think I did read that it supported window splits
<gehidore> zoidq so use i3-wm
<zoidq> i3 ftw!
<PatrolDoom> yeah it does window splits but idk if so in the way you want...
<zoidq> irssi wasn't working great without it's meta key that i3's hogging, did you get around that problem gehidore?
<PatrolDoom> mine looks like basically curses hexchat
<zoidq> PatrolDoom: yeah that's exactly what I'm after
<zoidq> I'm running on a 38" 4k monitor so lots of space to see everything at once
* PatrolDoom human eye can only process what 6MP
<zoidq> added filter for join/part, it's nice that it affects the existing buffer
<zoidq> haha well those boundaries are changing all the time, not the human eye but what we perceive as being factual
<zoidq> they said that when we were running on 320x256 (probably...)
<PatrolDoom> wut
<PatrolDoom> quit all that talking like trump
<zoidq> my people said it was so
<PatrolDoom> "perceive as being factual"
<zoidq> I don't question my people PatrolDoom 
<occultus> zoidq: if it's the meta key that's a problem, it will be a problem for weechat too. if you set $mod=mod4 so i3 uses super key instead, most of those problems go away
<zoidq> occultus: I was recently trying to figure out how to swap them around, I can just reassign the super key from the i3 conf?1
<zoidq> I didn't put a lot of effort into researching it at the time tbh
<occultus> zoidq: it's in the i3 users guide near the beginning i'm pretty sure
<zoidq> right, docs!  well I'll check it out shortly, thanks for the tip
<occultus> although there are three or four places that i call the "beginning" of the users guide...
<PatrolDoom> occultus: perceiving facts are we 
<zoidq> I created a decent i3 config a long time ago and just migrate it to all my stations tbh, the slacker way
<PatrolDoom> occultus: there is only one beginning - the beginning
<PatrolDoom> zoidq: you mean asking in here until someone answers ;o
<zoidq> well.. err..
<zoidq> hmm
* PatrolDoom pokes zoidq moar
<PatrolDoom> thurstylark: wake up 
<zoidq> still didn't manage to solve screen tearing in i3 properly either.. I have explored compton but apart for breaking dmenu with it's default fadein/out animation, the screen tearing issue still existed.. actually think that my panel might have something to do with it too
<zoidq> :)
<alyptik> zoidq‚Ä∫ using intel or nvidia?
<zoidq> nvidia atm,   although the issue was present with the onboard hd530 too
<zoidq> using the official driver, I mostly just have terminals and a browser open so it's not the biggest problem I guess
<archification> hey guys, best way to get flash working on firefox?
<PatrolDoom> !give archification aw flash
<phrik> archification: Flash - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Flash
<zoidq> looking at i3wm, I see the info on $mod, this is currently set to Mod1 (alt) as it seems to be in a more ergonomic position than super.. looks like I can assign i3 $mod to Mod4 and then using xmodmap, swap my super and alt inputs around.. perhaps that would become confusing
<Kanashio> There's always the capslock key.
<zoidq> hmm, that's true.  gets pressed one a year usually
<zoidq> once*
<agent_white> zoidq: I changed mine to the "windows key". Seems to fit in nicely.
<zoidq> agent_white: it would mitigate a lot of problems that's for sure
<watered> How do  check VRAM?
<PatrolDoom> !give watered question
<phrik> watered: http://arch.har-ikkje.net/gfx/question.jpg
<watered> dmesg |grep VRAM doesn't reveal anything :(
<watered> PatrolDoom, lol
<zoidq> PatrolDoom: grep -i --color memory /var/log/Xorg.0.log
<zoidq> depending on what you wanted to check
<PatrolDoom> zoidq: think you meant that for watered 
<watered> Nothing shows up when I type that
<zoidq> err, yeah - thanks :P

<watered> <watered> <watered> Any clue anyone?
<watered> <watered> <watered> Got these errors on wine
<watered> I posted this earlier
<watered> I have intel integrated and mesa is installed
<zoidq> watered: have you tested that 3d acceleration is working ok?
<zoidq> you could install mesa-demos and run glxgears or something
<watered> zoidq, Is there something wrong about this?
<watered> http://i.imgur.com/AvsbMSo.png
<agent_white> The amount of transparency on your windows is 
<watered> glxgears works perfect
<zoidq> watered: not too sure about any problems in the screenshot.. if glxgears works then at least your 3d acceleration is working ok
<zoidq> it's been years since I played with wine tbh, mostly use vm's these days
<Lartza> I've never used wine with intel :S
<zoidq> are you launching the program with the "-opengl" flag? 
<Lartza> If mesa, mesa-libgl and possibly lib32-mesa-libgl is installed and 3D acceleartion works then :S
<Lartza> What pprogram is it?
<watered> pes 2017
<zoidq> I'm gonna have to get ready for work, slacking here will resume then.. good luck watered 
<watered> zoidq, thanks :D
<Lartza> 32-bit wine prefix?
<watered> the vmalloctotal in screenshot is not weird?
<watered> yup 32 bit prefix
<watered> made sure
<Lartza> Check that DRI3 is enabled for xorg? Try the intel driver instead of modesetting?
<Lartza> Not really sure :S
<watered> rockect league.exe works just fine
<watered> not sure whats up with pes
<Lartza> Rocket league is native nowadays do you know that? :P
<watered> yea.. but considering wine....
<Lartza> Hmm rocket league is DX9 too though
<watered> There is a warning about memory below 512 though
<watered> I click ignore
<Lartza> :P
<watered> I need to know how to change the dedicated value
<Lartza> BIOS
<watered> intel integrated has those capabilities right?
<Lartza> BIOS
<Lartza> :)
<Lartza> It should
<watered> bios max is 150 i guess
<Lartza> If it's a laptop then it might be screwed
<Lartza> I can go over 150
<Lartza> What GPU?
<watered> I've seen people get it up to 512mb on windows
<watered> intel HD 3000 integrated
<Lartza> Ohh that's fairly old :S
<watered> yea this laptops old... but if the game even starts up it'll be an achievement
<Lartza> You should really try the intel xorg driver
<watered> how do i fo that
<Lartza> Modesetting works better, for new Intel gpu's
<watered> wheres the setting? :P
<Lartza> Install xf86-video-intel
<watered> Thats already installed
<Lartza> :S
<Lartza> Try removing that package and using the modesetting driver? :D
<watered> If I remove that package .. what are the chances of me facing a black screen?
<Lartza> Uhh, some, why?
<watered> The thing is Rocket League works
<watered> I guess it's on account of low vram it isn't working
<watered> where can I adjust Vram?
<Lartza> Not sure, the error should be different imo
<Lartza> BIOS
<Lartza> You cannot set it anywhere else than bios
<watered> other than ..
<watered> oh
<watered> guess it's time to reboot
<watered> brb
<Lartza> The GPU has no dedicated VRAM
<watered> Lartza, Ah shit.. rocket league shows the same error
<watered> something went wrong
<watered> Rocket league used to work before
<Lartza> With modesetting?
<watered> :(
<Lartza> Probably the fact that modesetting works for newer cards mostly, so it was a longshot :S
<watered> no.. like I just tried the game after long time and the same shit as pes happened
<Lartza> Ahh
<Lartza> Wine has probably updated
<watered> This sucks
<watered> :O
<Lartza> But other than that... strange
<Lartza> And a wine update shouldn't break anything like that
<watered> here's the tail

<watered> yup
<watered> did it paste though?
<Lartza> Enough yes...
<Lartza> That doesn't really tell much though
<Lartza> apart from Wine not being able to use your GPU for some reason
<Lartza> Or your GPU not supporting DRI or something
<watered> damn it!
<watered> lemme try cs
<watered> also VRam expansion disabled
<watered> http://i.imgur.com/txUdBKG.png
<Lartza> Expansion ROM? that has nothing to do with vram
<watered> oh
<Lartza> ...
<hejki> how do you read anything with so many semi-transparent layers - that is just way beyond comprehensible :D
<Lartza> It looks horrid yeah...
<watered> I got used to it
<Lartza> And again, only your BIOS can handle how much of your RAM is turned into the Intel GPU's VRAM
<Silenced> Any terminator users ?
<watered> It adds some kinda depth
<Lartza> Silenced, I have used terminator in the past? Just ask?
<watered> And added bonous .. no one else likes using my computer
<Lartza> I'd just turn it off and use it
<Lartza> lol
<watered> :D
<Silenced> I need to hide the scrollbar in terminator. I have changed in preferences. But it still appears when i split the terminator window. Any suggestions to fix this ?
<Lartza> Silenced, I'm fairly sure it's a bug
<Lartza> Since this happens: Disable scrollbar in profile, scrollbar is gone every time you start terminator
<Lartza> Split the terminal, scrollbar appears, open settings and immediately close it, all scrollbars disappear (as if profiles get re-applied when you close the settings window)
<root____1> On live-cd now. I fscked up my arch install pacman reports it needs libkeyutils.so.1 inside arch-chroot. What can I do ? Is deboostrap safe or do I have to manually download libkeyutils?
<root____1> latest one is a pain in the a**
<root____1> can I use pacman outside of the chroot to install something inside of an arch install?
<xkonni> pacstrap iirc...
<Namarrgon> debootstrap is not safe in this case. how did you get into this mess?
<Silenced> Lartza: Exactly facing the issue as you described. Anyway to fix it ?
<Lartza> As I said, I think it's a bug
<root____1> Namarrgon: i installed kde then found out it isn't as good as xfce. Removed it and found out about some left overs. Than just pacman -Rssdd them but it uninstalled some critical components aswell because I carelessely selected a package that started with k
<Lartza> Silenced, Though weirdly enough, terminator-bzr does not have this issue
<Lartza> But it's also not using my GTK theme
<Silenced> ok 
<Lartza> So possibly it's a bug introduced in their new terminator versiojn
<Namarrgon> root____1: pacstrap the base group
<Lartza> Silenced, In either case I'd contact the devs :)
<Lartza> Or check their issue tracker etc
<ShapeShifter499> hi
<Silenced> Yeah. Will check
<ShapeShifter499> anyone here using "icetea" for their java plugin?    How can I whitelist a page?    
<watered> Oh wait
<watered> Rocket league doesn't work on gallium
<ShapeShifter499> I don't want to have to click a million yes prompts to load a java based game
<watered> it uses the stagging
<watered> CMST something
<Lartza> Just use native rocket league :P
<watered> yea i know.. just testing wine :P
<Lartza> CSMT shouldn't be needed for RL wine though
<watered> gallium doesn't work for me apparently
<watered> I guess it isn't meant for integrated cards?
<Lartza> Don't start generalizing with your old Intel GPU :P
<Lartza> You're three generations behind ;)
<watered> ofc not
<watered> I was talking about the shitty one I'm using
<watered> :P
<Lartza> You can always try the CSMT patches
<watered> you mean specific to my laptop?
<Lartza> No
<Lartza> CSMT patches are great for performance, for everyone
<watered> AUR?
<Lartza> No, they should be in wine-staging now
<Lartza> Just need to be enabled from winecfg
<watered> yea.. it's either CSMT or gallium.. can't select both
<watered> But isn't gallium support better? :O
<watered> performance wise too?
<Lartza> Uhh dunno
<Lartza> nvidia propietary != gallium
<Lartza> And that's what I've always used with Wine
<Lartza> :P
<watered> ah
<Lartza> And not sure if and how gallium would be faster than CSMT, and why the other cancels the other
<echosystm> do i need to open ports in iptables for dhcp?
<echosystm> my computer seems to lose its network connection after about 2 days
<yousuc> echosystm: yes
<echosystm> what ports and why?
<echosystm> it gets an initial address no problem, so i assume it is just lease timeouts that are the problem
<yousuc> after the ip address is assigned
<yousuc> iptables then firesoff
<echosystm> ok
<yousuc> but really best solution is to assign a static ip
<yousuc> IPTABLES  -I INPUT -i $LAN_IFACE -p udp --dport 67:68 --sport 67:68 -j ACCEPT
<yousuc> is what u could define
<yousuc> if u wish to keep using dhcp
<echosystm> ok cool thanks

<piousminion> Hi, I'm wanting to try BtrFS with a setup like ssd(/boot,LUKS(LVM(swap,BtrFS-root))). Is there anything I should watch out for? Tips?
<c0nch1t0> !give piousmunio aw btrfs
<phrik> piousmunio: Btrfs - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Btrfs
<Keridos> is there a way to free certain cpu cores from all but one thread?
<Keridos> I currently notice my windows 10 vm with qemu gets slower when I have a bit more cpu usage at my host system
<Keridos> the host system should be able to use the 2 cores (1 virtual 1 physical) I did not assign to the VM for everything it needs but apparently it still is assigning threads to the VM's cpu cores
<piousminion> c0nch1t0: I'm there now and have been for some time. :P
<esph> piousminion: it doesn't make much sense to put btrfs on lvm.
<piousminion> esph: Without LVM, how would I include a resumable swap partition in the encryption?
<esph> piousminion: you can use a swap file
<piousminion> esph: Not on BtrFS
<esph> Oh, you can't?
<piousminion> esph: Not according to the Arch Wiki page for BtrFS.
<esph> piousminion: ah, I see that now.
<esph> piousminion: I haven't used btrfs, just lvm, but I've repeatedly seen the more knowledgeable users in this channel say that btrfs on lvm is silly.
<piousminion> I'm tempted to do away with hybernation support and just use a second partition with a random LUKS key.
<c0nch1t0> piousmunio: sorry i'm on ext4.
<esph> piousminion: oh, and maybe this will show you how to do it with just btrfs? https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Btrfs_subvolumes_with_swap
